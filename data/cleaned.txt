tokyo-bound sampson sets aust rifle record. shooter dane sampson has struck career-best form as he builds towards a third olympics, setting a national record while winning the 50m rifle event at the south australia championships. sampson registered a score of 462 points to claim gold in the three positions event. the performance bettered sampson's own national record of 460.7 points, which he achieved at last month's wingfield grand prix. the score was also notably higher than what italy's niccolo campriani (458.8) and poland's tomasz bartnik (460.4) produced to win gold at the 2016 olympics and 2018 world championships respectively. "it's good to be shooting pbs at this stage. it was a world-class finals score," sampson said, having previously competed at the 2012 and 2016 olympics. "you are unlikely to lose many competitions with that score. "i definitely feel that i am getting better and better and i am tracking well for tokyo." sampson and other members of australia's shooting team for the 2021 olympics are set to come together for a pre-games camp on july 4-19. the camp is intended to mimic the biosecurity bubble and strict protocols that await in tokyo.

what’s your role in anglogold ashanti? – sam jonah questioned. after his public address to rotary club in accra, sam kwesi esson jonah kbe, has come under immense criticism from persons close to the government who feel that portions of his address attacked the executive. the latest criticism is coming from paul adom-otchere, host of good evening ghana (geg), who in his biweekly show on metro tv, tried to ‘punch holes’ in the senior stateman’s speech. according to him, sam jonah kbe, must have had a role in ashanti gold which later turned into anglogold ashanti, therefore, he should be able to tell the young people of ghana the role he played while working with the company. on his show, thursday, april 29, 2021, adom-otchere stated that, if sam jonah kbe wants to talk about the future of ghana, then he must first of all open up about his past. “sam jonah cannot come and talk about the future without answering questions about his past...it behoves him to make statements about his past. if he won’t say anything at all, at least we know his role with adisadel college and ashgold football club, we do not know his role in that major transaction that has punctuated the corporate and political history of our society, the ashanti transaction,” paul adom-otchere said on his show monitored by ghanaweb. he indicated that, there are two ashanti transactions, one was failed by the government of ghana, which left a lot of rancour’s between jj rawlings and sam jonah and their relationship broke off completely. “we don’t know the details. sam jonah must come and tell us. and then the transaction was rehashed and relaunched in 2001 and 2002, this time it was supported by the ja kufuor government and it was successful. in both transactions, there was a critical decision about the heritage of the ghanaian young person; because this gold resource, which is a ghanaian resource was being treated in a certain way, was it being treated in the right way to guarantee the future of the young people that today sam jonah is concerned about? “was it being treated in a certain way that eventually guaranteed our future? was there an option with randgold resources and other people who wanted to participate that could have been better for the future of ghana?” he asked. adom-otchere stressed that, sam jonah kbe must answer these questions. “he [sam jonah] is a big man, he has been around for a very long time, and he comes and says the youth of ghana, i now feel the responsibility to speak and you don’t tell us what you’ve been doing in the past, when you have had such a tenacious relationship with the political decision making of ghana since 1983; you won’t tell us what has happened about that…?” paul adom-otchere argues that, sam jonah’s answer to the question will help the ghanaian youth understand whether or not he has found a new philosophy or a new idea. “so that we can understand whether the idea you present today is the idea that has been with you for a very long time. if that idea that you present today is not an idea that has been with for a long time, it is still a welcome idea but we want to know so that we put it on record because the record is important,” he stressed.

*excluding japan and china komatsu's operations by region are described below. japan for the fiscal year under review, demand remained steady, centering on public works, on which the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic had a small impact. nevertheless, sales declined from the previous fiscal year, as adversely affected by slack private-sector construction as well as limited sales and service activities in the first six-month period. americas in north america, sales dropped from the previous fiscal year. while demand for construction equipment was on a recovery track in the housing sector and the rental industry, it was adversely affected by sluggish economic conditions under the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic and that for construction and mining equipment remained slack in the energy-related sector. in latin america, demand for construction equipment remained steady in brazil, and sales of mining equipment increased to chilean copper mines. however, sales declined from the previous fiscal year, as mainly affected by the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic, especially in the first six- month period. europe and cis in europe, sales decreased from the previous fiscal year, as demand remained sluggish in the first six-month period, although demand was on a recovery track from the adverse effects of the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic in the major markets of germany, the united kingdom, and france, as well as in italy. in cis, sales declined, affected by sluggish demand for mining equipment in coal mines and depreciation of the russian ruble, while demand was steady in gold mines and that for construction equipment was on a recovery track in infrastructure development and energy-related sectors. china while the share of sales made by domestic manufacturers increased, demand remained steady, supported by the government's economic stimulus measures, such as infrastructure investment, after containing the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic. furthermore, demand advanced in the fiscal year under review, driven by the post-chinese new year sales season in february, and because the previous year's sales season in february was pushed back by the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic. as a result, sales increased from the previous fiscal year. asia and oceania in asia, demand showed steady recovery, centering on construction equipment, in indonesia, thailand, and malaysia, and some signs of recovery for mining equipment emerged in coal mines in indonesia in the fourth quarter against the backdrop of recovering coal prices. however, sales dropped sharply from the previous fiscal year, as particularly affected by the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic in the first six-month period. in oceania, sales increased, supported by steady demand for mining equipment in iron ore mines, as well as for construction equipment. middle east and africa in the middle east, sales improved from the previous fiscal year, supported by steady demand, especially in turkey, while demand remained slack in saudi arabia, largely affected by sluggish crude oil prices and the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic. in africa, demand for construction equipment remained slack in southern africa, mainly affected by the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic. while some signs of recovery of demand surfaced in other regions, sales declined, as affected by reduced sales of mining equipment as well. retail finance while assets increased, reflecting an increase in new contracts centering on north america as well as the affects of foreign exchange rates in the fourth quarter, revenues decreased by 6.4% from the previous fiscal year, to jpy 66.3 billion, as affected by a drop in new contracts in the nine-month period. segment profit fell by 16.6% to jpy 10.5 billion, mainly reflecting the adverse effects of an extension of payments and revaluation of vehicles after lease use. industrial machinery and others for the fiscal year under review, sales fell by 3.6% from the previous fiscal year, to jpy 171.2 billion. this was mainly affected by slack capital investment of the automobile manufacturing industry for presses, sheet-metal machines, and machine tools, as well as their delayed installation at customers' overseas workplaces, especially under the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic. meanwhile, segment profit increased by 19.3% to jpy 16.3 billion, as sales remained steady for excimer laser-related business in the semiconductor market. [projections for the fiscal year ending march 31, 2022] (from april 1, 2021 to march 31, 2022) in the construction, mining and utility equipment business, komatsu projects that both sales and profits will increase, as it believes that demand will continue to recover from the fiscal year under review, returning to the level prior to the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic. by region, komatsu anticipates demand will expand, especially in asia, north america and latin america. in china, komatsu expects that demand will decline from the fiscal year under review, when the post-chinese new year sales season occurred twice. nevertheless, komatsu projects that global demand will increase from the fiscal year under review. furthermore, komatsu projects that demand for mining equipment will remain steady in iron ore, copper, and gold mines, while it will enter a recovery track in coal mines. with respect to profits, komatsu expects that they will advance, reflecting an increase in volume of sales, differences in composition of sales, and improved selling prices. in the retail finance business, komatsu anticipates both sales and segment profit will improve, mainly due to an increase in new contracts. in the industrial machinery and others business, komatsu projects that both sales and profits will increase, as sales of machine tools and the excimer laser-related business should grow, respectively, in the automobile manufacturing industry and on the semiconductor market. as preconditions for its projection, komatsu is assuming the foreign exchange rates will be as follows: usd1=jpy 105.0, eur1=jpy 124.0, and rmb1=jpy  notes: markets as positioned by komatsu traditional markets: japan, north america and europe strategic markets: china, latin america, asia, oceania, africa, middle east and cis [projections] millions of yen 2022 2021 projection results changes usd1=jpy105.0 usd1=jpy106.0 increase eur1=jpy124.0 eur1=jpy123.4 (decrease) rmb1=jpy16.0 rmb1=jpy15.6 [a] [b] [(a-b)/b] net sales 2,469,000 2,189,512 12.8% construction, mining and utility equipment 2,243,000 1,975,958 13.5% retail finance 68,000 66,394 2.4% industrial machinery and others 175,000 171,255 2.2% elimination (17,000) (24,095) - segment profit 225,000 172,339 30.6% construction, mining and utility equipment 198,000 143,788 37.7% retail finance 12,000 10,574 13.5% industrial machinery and others 17,000 16,342 4.0% corporate & elimination (2,000) 1,635 - operating income 225,000 167,328 34.5% income before income taxes and equity 217,000 162,775 33.3% in earnings of affiliated companies net income attributable to komatsu ltd. 146,000 106,237 37.4% note: unless otherwise noted, all sales by segment in this report indicate the amounts before elimination of inter-segment transactions. (2) financial conditions as of march 31, 2021, while inventories decreased from the previous fiscal year-end, total assets increased by jpy 131.1 billion to jpy 3,784.8 billion, due largely to the japanese yen's depreciation against the  dollar and some other currencies as well as increased receivables. interest-bearing debt decreased by jpy 102.3 billion from the previous fiscal year-end, to jpy 909.9 billion. komatsu ltd. shareholders' equity increased by jpy 140.6 billion from the previous fiscal year-end, to jpy 1,912.2 billion. as a result, komatsu ltd. shareholders' ratio increased by 2.0 percentage points from the previous fiscal year-end, to 50.5%. for the fiscal year under review, net cash provided by operating activities totaled jpy 354.1 billion, an increase of jpy 58.9 billion from the previous fiscal year, largely reflecting decreased inventories. net cash used in investing activities amounted to jpy 163.0 billion, a decrease of jpy 27.8 billion from the previous fiscal year, due mainly to the purchase of fixed assets. net cash used in financing activities amounted to jpy 199.6 billion (as compared to jpy 3.4 billion used for the previous fiscal year), mainly due to the repayment of debt and payment of cash dividends. after adding the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations to the total amount of each cash flow, as of march 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled jpy 241.8 billion, a decrease of jpy 5.8 billion from the previous fiscal year-end.

cash provided by operating activities     basic policy for redistribution of profits and dividends for the fiscal year under review and next fiscal year    komatsu is building a sound financial position and enhancing its competitiveness in order to increase its sustainable corporate value. concerning cash dividends, komatsu has the policy of continuing stable payment of dividends after comprehensively considering consolidated business results and reviewing future investment plans, cash flows and the like. specifically, komatsu has the policy of maintaining a consolidated payout ratio of 40% or higher. as described earlier in this report, while demand declined in the construction, mining, and utility equipment business, as adversely affected by the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic, it has recovered sooner than expected, since the third quarter, centering on construction equipment. as a result, both sales and profits for the year outperformed the projection of consolidated business results for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2021, which komatsu announced on october 28, 2020. concerning cash dividends for the fiscal year under review, after considering consolidated business results for the fiscal year under review and future business prospects under its dividend policy, the company is planning to increase the year-end common stock dividend per share by jpy 2 from the earlier projection of jpy 25 per share. at the same time, the company plans to pay the 100th anniversary (may 13, 2021) commemorative cash dividend of jpy 10 per share. as a result, year-end cash dividends for the fiscal year under review should amount to jpy 37 per share, , jpy 12 more than the latest projection of cash dividends. annual cash dividends should total jpy 55 per share, including the interim cash dividend which has already been paid, and which is showing a decrease of jpy 39 per share from the previous fiscal year, ended march 31, 2020. accordingly, the consolidated payout ratio will translate into 48.9%. this dividend amount will be proposed to the 152nd ordinary general meeting of shareholders (scheduled for june 18, 2021). regarding annual cash dividends for the fiscal year, ending march 31, 2022, the company plans to pay jpy 62 per share, an increase of jpy 7 per share from the fiscal year under review. cautionary statement the announcement

watch the visuals of kddo and davido’s ‘beamer body’. kddo has finally released the visuals for the davido-assisted song beamer body , which is from the stable of sony music entertainment west africa and pentlife music. kddo first teased the collaboration in the final quarter of last year, and it’s been highly-anticipated ever since. the release of this new banger is also sequel to the successful run of his recent and critically acclaimed amapiano music hit,   ewallet  that shook the nation with style. speaking on the track, kddo remembers linking up with music heavyweight, davido while on tour last year in las vegas to record  beamer body . “i had already started working on the single back in la. davido and i were playing music back at the hotel in vegas, then the beat came on and we were all just vibing. david really liked it, he got mad hyped about it and added a verse on the spot”  says kddo. while  beamer body  beat is infectious and attacked with melodies from the musical duo, its focal message (adequately represented in glimpses from the music video directed by chris simon) seeks to empower beautiful women from around the world to be comfortable in their bodies. “ feel sexy, baby! there’s something about you ,” kddo adds.   interestingly, “ beamer body ” also serves as the lead single to his forth-coming debut ep project too late too lit , which is now available for  pre-order/pre-save  on music streaming platforms. the ep has been designed to be a feel-good body of work for the fans and we probably have the pandemic to thank for catalysing kddo’s efforts to drop. kddo will continue his genius operation from his base in los angeles, building upon his laurels in music some of which already include “ 1st afrobeats riaa gold award ”; “ producer of the year ”; “ music producer of the year ”; “ longest-charting nigerian pop song in billboard history  ( fall  performed by davido)”; “ top 100 most shazam-ed singles in america ”; “ 1st nigerian producer to sell multi-platinum in south africa ,” and also extending his collaborative reach beyond the prominence of superstars davido, chris brown, aka, mayorkun, cardi b, beyonce and popcaan.

man utd hammer roma 6-2 in europa league semi-final. bruno fernandes and edinson cavani both scored twice as manchester united came from behind to take a major step towards sealing a place in next month’s europa league final. fernandes gave united a perfect start in their semi-final with italian side roma when he swept home cavani’s first-time lay-off. paul pogba’s handball allowed lorenzo pellegrini to equalise before the roma skipper’s pass allowed former manchester city striker edin dzeko to score his sixth goal in five old trafford appearances to turn the tie on its head by half-time. but united rallied after the break. cavani levelled with a superb first-time effort before tapping the hosts back in front when substitute keeper antonio mirante pushed aaron wan-bissaka’s angled shot into his path. ole gunnar solskjaer’s men were in no mood to let their advantage slip a second time, although it took a fortunate penalty for what seemed to be an innocuous chris smalling tackle on cavani to give fernandes the chance add a fourth from the spot. pogba then powered home a precise header from fernandes’ cross before greenwood ran on to cavani’s pass and drove home united’s sixth, making them the first side to score six goals in a major european semi-final since real madrid in the 1964 european cup. the final scoreline did not quite match united’s epic 7-1 champions league triumph against the same opponents in 2007 but for solskjaer, a substitute on that famous night, it was just as sweet. after four successive semi-final defeats in 15 months, the norwegian really needs to get beyond that stage to silence his doubters, some of whom were never convinced he should have succeeded jose mourinho as united boss and point to an absence of silverware that both his predecessor and louis van gaal delivered in shorter reigns at the club. solskjaer’s double fist-pump reaction to cavani’s equaliser underlined the importance of the uruguayan’s superb effort, swept into the top corner and part of a two-goal, three-assist contribution from the striker, whose contract expires in the summer. for once, it meant fernandes had to share top billing as he claimed two assists to go with his brace – although after a below-par couple of months, the portuguese seems to have recovered his form at the right time. pogba is united’s other big-name player and the midfielder ended an up-and-down night very much on the positive side, celebrating his header in style as the pressure was released. greenwood’s effort means only a catastrophe in the second leg can prevent united reaching their eighth european final.  – bbc

nars pure radiant tinted moisturizer new shades: our honest review. as our social calendars are refilling once again, it’s time to dust off your makeup bag. if your once beloved products are looking past their sell by date - we have good news. nars has relaunched its iconic , which is now available in 16 shades for a more inclusive selection than ever. a hybrid between foundation and moisturiser, the multitasking product is ideal for creating the coveted ‘skinmalism’ natural makeup look. it packs your skin with hydration, while treating it to a fresh-from-holiday glow. nars’ pure radiant tinted moisturizer has long been a favourite among those in the know with its buildable, oil-free formula. it has spf30 and contains the powerhouse combination of antioxidant-rich vitamin c to protect your skin against environmental aggressors and leave a radiant finish as well as french polynesian kopara to nourish and refine your complexion. “i am crazy about healthy beautiful skin!”, explains françois nars, nars founder & creative director. “i love the weightless texture, rich pigment, and the glow that this product gives to any and every complexion. it is wonderful for all skin types and has a sheerness that allows for your skin’s unique qualities to shine through. it’s also totally effortless.” the es best shopping team took four shades of the  for a spin - here’s what we thought. ellie davis acting shopping editor shades: light 3 groenland (for light skin with peach undertones) & light 2 alaska (for light skins with golden undertones) after nearing a year of not wearing makeup, this tinted moisturiser from nars acted as the perfect stepping stone i needed after the restrictions eased. i must admit, i feel a bit rusty on the makeup front but this product was a breeze, giving my skin the hydration it desperately needs while coating it with good, buildable coverage and a luminous glow. it is more pigmented than some of the other tinted moisturisers on the market, which was a welcomed treat to my very pale lockdown complexion. i went for two different shades; alaska and groenland - the former to suit my aforementioned vitamin d-deficient skin and the other after a good tanning session courtesy of . i applied the product with a damp beauty blender and it went on a treat, spreading seamlessly over my skin. foolproof. abha shah, digital shopping writer shades: med-deep 1 santiago (for mediumdeep skin with subtle golden undertones) and med-deep 2 marrakesh (for medium-deep skin with olive undertones) i’ve always thought the point of makeup is being able to see it. why bother otherwise? at least, i had thought that until the pandemic put my makeup kit on furlough. for the best really, my skin needed the break. now we’ve been given the green light to venture out into the world, it feels strange to apply the full face i used to do on autopilot in the mornings. the arrival of nars’s new tinted moisturiser feels timely. available in 16 shades, there were a few options for my indian skin. i plumped for santiago, which suits medium deep skin with subtle golden undertones, and marrakesh, made for medium-deep skin with olive undertones. squeezing the tube, i was at first dubious over nars description of this product as a moisturiser - it very much looks like foundation. but i soon found it’s far thinner, leaving my pores ‘dressed’ but feeling as though they could ‘breathe’. the first ‘coat’, while still allowing stubborn acne scars to show through, balanced the medley of tones across my face well. not a full makeover but rather, a gentle fine-tuning. the tinted moisturiser is easily buildable if you want to strengthen your base, but it also pairs well with concealer and bronzer, offering a mildly polished look that feels comfortable as i prepare for the great re-emergence. i’d happily wear this to the office, and save the stronger stuff for a big night out. this content is not available due to your privacy preferences. read more

tokyo's key nikkei index opens lower. tokyo: tokyo's key nikkei 225 index opened lower on friday in subdued trade during japan's golden week holiday period. the benchmark nikkei 225 index was down  percent or  points at 28, in early trade, while the broader topix index gained  percent or  points to 1, investors were closing their positions after a national holiday on thursday and ahead of an extended weekend that will see the market closed from monday until wednesday. normal trading will resume from thursday. "in early trade, selling related to position adjustments ahead of the holiday period are dominating the market, rather than the market reflecting strong us shares," okasan online securities said. on wall street, the dow finished up 0.7 percent, as did the s&p 500. the tech-rich nasdaq rose 0.2 percent. the tokyo market remained well supported following the us federal open market committee's latest meeting, while investors digested the biden administration's policy announcement, analysts said. worries over the olympics were also weighing on the tokyo market. "there are lingering speculations about the possible cancellation of the olympics, which make japanese shares unattractive to buy," okasan said. the tokyo games are scheduled to open on july 23, but the capital and other economic hubs in japan are seeing a fresh surge in coronavirus cases. hospitals in the western city of osaka are struggling to cope with the spike in infections, and japan's government has imposed a state of emergency for the city and its surrounding areas, as well as in tokyo. doctors and medical experts are increasingly speaking out against holding the pandemic-postponed games, while polls have long suggested that the public largely support a cancellation or a delay. the dollar stood at  yen, little changed from  yen in new york overnight. the government said japan's factory output in march rose 2.2 percent from the previous month. among major shares, sony group plunged  percent to 11,140 yen. chipmaker murata manufacturing dropped  percent to 8,737 yen, and toyota lost  percent to 8,203 yen. but softbank group firmed  percent to 9,983 yen. medical equipment maker olympus added  percent to 2,255.5 yen. nintendo rose  percent to 62,710 yen.

3 common mistakes investors make with penny stocks - the motley fool uk. in for a penny, in for a pound? penny stocks can seem appealing. the idea that an investment that costs a matter of pence could generate pounds of rewards can be beguiling. but there are a lot of simple mistakes investors make choosing penny stocks. here are three i’ve observed. focus on price not value here’s a thought experiment. let’s say my children could travel to school in the cheapest bus the school can buy — or the most expensive. which would i prefer? the answer seems obvious. for most people, quality is worth paying for. yet penny stocks can focus our attention on price not value. the legendary investor warren buffett said that “price is what you pay, value is what you get”. a penny stock could indeed turn out to be good value. but to assess what the underlying value is, i’d look not just at the price. i’dd also consider the company’s future ability to generate profits and create shareholder value. penny stocks and balance sheets one common mistake investors make is buying on share price alone without looking at the company’s balance sheet. imagine buying a second hand car for £100. that might sound like a bargain. but if it needs to have an mot the following week that identifies £3,000 of necessary repairs, even the £100 price tag could seem like a bad bargain in retrospect. it’s the same when a company has a lot of debt or other future financial obligations that dwarf its financial resources. how will it pay them? will it have a rights issue and dilute shareholders as a penny stock like hammerson did last year? balance sheets scare many people. but they aren’t as technical as they may sound. before investing in any penny stocks i’d always spend at least a few minutes looking at a company’s recent balance sheets. seeing what a company’s debt profile looks like is a crucial indicator of its financial health, in my view. single-asset focus a lot of penny stocks are exclusively or mainly focused on a single asset. i find that’s particularly true with early-stage resource stocks. for example, bacanora lithium is pinning a lot of hope on one project in mexico. sometimes, such a focus is positive and a lack of diversification can amplify rewards. if a company owns one mining licence and literally strikes gold, its return on capital could be huge. but the reverse is true as well – if a company is over-concentrated in one asset, the lack of diversification can disproportionately damage it. single-asset focus improves potential reward only by increasing potential risk, in many cases. that matters because, as warren buffett reminds us: “rule number one: never lose money. rule number two: never forget rule number one”. that can be hard to do. but by learning from common mistakes other investors make, i hope i can improve my likely returns when identifying penny stocks to consider for my portfolio.

man ends life after wife tests +ve. rajkot: not the just the pandemic, but also the mental trauma caused by the fear of being infected by coronavirus is turning out to be fatal. in an incident highlighting the issue, a 55-year-old man allegedly ended his life by suicide in rajkot city on wednesday after his wife tested positive for covid-19. according to police, the deceased, identified as hashmukh chavda, was a resident of valkeshwar society in rajkot city. chavda and his wife nirmalaben went for covid-19 testing on wednesday morning. nirmalaben tested positive for covid-19 so their son rajendra took her to a doctor for further treatment. chavda, alone at home during that time, allegedly committed suicide. when nirmalaben and rajendra returned home they found him hanging from a ceiling fan. “chavda’s son rajendra told police that his father was worried about getting infected with the virus after nirmalaben tested positive and therefore he ended his life,” police said. rajendra chavda works as a goldsmith while his father used to work as a mason. though the numbers aren’t alarming as of now, a disturbing trend of positive persons developing suicidal tendencies has come to the fore. in last 10 days, at least five covid-19 patients have ended their lives by committing suicides in different parts of saurashtra region.

royal canadian mint reports profits and performance for 2020. ottawa, on, april 30, 2021 /cnw/ - the royal canadian mint (the "mint") is pleased to announce its financial results for 2020 that provide insight into our activities, the markets influencing our businesses and our expectations for the next 12 months. "in 2020, employees of the royal canadian mint demonstrated their ability to innovate and deliver great products in a very challenging operating environment" said marie lemay, president and ceo of the royal canadian mint. "their hard work contributed to the mint's success. employees pivoted quickly in the face of disruption allowing the mint to generate strong profits."   "the mint continues to respond to the unprecedented situation with covid-19 in a proactive way that prioritizes the health and safety of our employees. we have adapted our production to be able to continue delivering critical services in support of the essential mining and financial sectors, while adhering to strict new protocols to ensure our work environment is a safe one." "one very special initiative in 2020 was our recognition medal, created to recognize frontline workers while raising money for the breakfast club of canada's covid-19 emergency fund. employees donated their time to this project and thanks to their generosity and the contrinutions of thousands of canadians, the mint was able to make a $400,000 donation to the breakfast club in 2020."  the financial results should be read in conjunction with the mint's annual report available at  all monetary amounts are expressed in canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated. financial and operational highlights the mint increased its revenue by 74% in 2020 as a result of exceptionally strong global market demand for bullion while consolidated profit before income tax and other items was $27.5 million for the year (2019 – $42.3 million). higher bullion volumes sold in 2020 increased the mint's revenue and cost of sales proportionately; however, the mint's profit margin was impacted in 2020 by lower revenue from its other businesses, without a corresponding decrease in costs. in particular, the mint continued to pay its employees and did not reduce any fixed costs during the periods of suspended or modified production as a result of the pandemic impacting the mint's profit margin in 2020 by approximately $6 million. consolidated revenue increased to $2,527.6 million in 2020 (2019 - $1,453.4 million). gold bullion volumes increased more than 100% year over year and were 982.8 thousand ounces (2019 – 483.0 thousand ounces) while silver bullion volumes were 29.5 million ounces (2019 – 22.8 million ounces). sales of numismatic products decreased to $91.9 million in 2020 (2019 - $116.8 million) due mainly to the temporary suspension of numismatic product production as a result of covid-19 in 2020. revenue from the foreign circulation business decreased 2% to $64.2 million (2019 - $65.4 million) with production and/or shipments of 838 million coins in 2020 and blanks compared to 1,308 million coins and blanks in 2019. canadian circulation coins produced and sold to the department of finance for inventory were 229 million pieces in 2020 (2019 – 385 million pieces) while coins sold to financial institutions to meet demand decreased 8% year over year. operating expenses, overall, increased 4% year over year to $98.5 million (2019 – $94.5 million) as the mint focused on enhanced organizational resiliency in 2020 and the development of its updated long-term strategic vision and the strategy for the mint's future business transformation.   cash and cash equivalents increased to $67.3 million (december 31, 2019 -

‘waiting to die’: india grieves with bodies arriving in crematoriums ‘non-stop’, as covid-19 death toll climbs. as new infections increase at a record rate, people in india are dying waiting for beds with oxygen supplies running low, and hospitals crumbling under the strain. those on the ground claim the fatalities are being markedly underreported as people are dying 'left, right and centre.'        by avneet arora        warning: distressing content socked in a tiny village in gumtala in india’s northern state of punjab, rani thought her family was insulated from the perils of the pandemic that has gripped the country, primarily urban india. little did she know that virus is immune to the structural divide and would penetrate her home and claim the lives of three members of her family, in three days. highlights: 'i went to the cremation ground three times in three days' “i went to the cremation ground three times in three days,” says the inconsolable 55-year-old rani whose family has been tethered by the perilous virus that is roughly claiming 117 lives every hour. “first my daughter-in-law died of covid on april 20, then it claimed my son on april 21 and then my younger son’s grown-up child took ill. he too passed away after a few hours of his uncle’s death,” she says as she sobs on the phone. rani’s village is approximately 10 miles away from the nearest city amritsar that houses the golden temple, the holiest sikh shrine. the gutted mother says with her entire family of six down with covid-19, they did not have any support to take those critical to the hospital in the city. ‘it’s getting scarier by the minute’ rani’s horror story is being repeated across the country, particularly in the capital city new delhi, the epicentre of the deadly second wave, which has recorded over 3,000 deaths in the last ten days, according to the health ministry data. brisbane-based raj whose 78-year-old mother has tested positive is currently hunkered at a distant relative’s house in delhi because there’s no one to take care of her. the 38-year-old whose outward exemption was revoked after the travel ban says he doesn’t want his mother to become another statistic in the rising death toll. “i can’t be there with her and she is stuck at my aunt’s house in delhi. every time the phone rings, my heart stops because i fear for her wellbeing. the only respite is that she is at home and doesn’t have too many symptoms at this point,” raj says. “every time i switch on the tv, all i see is bodies wrapped in white bags piled on vehicles. it’s getting scarier by the minute,” he adds. ‘bodies are coming in non-stop’ the political seat of the south asian country is witnessing a staggering number of new infections daily, where survival has now become a luxury as people scramble for hospital beds, oxygen, ambulances, and a spot to lay their loved ones to rest. jyotjeet singh, the director of the disaster cell at shaheed bhagat singh sewa dal, a charity group that has been facilitating cremations for covid-afflicted fatalities tells sbs punjabi that the waiting time to get to a pyre is anywhere between eight to ten hours at the seemapuri crematorium, a site in northeast delhi where the group carries out cremations. “bodies are piling up. it’s 8:30 pm (local time) on 28 april and we have cremated over 144 bodies in a day at this site alone. last week, we were so overwhelmed with bodies that at one point, we ran out of wood for the pyres and had to appeal to people to send logs,” he says. mr singh says bodies are coming in “non-stop” and warns that if this goes on for a few more days, they will have to start burning the remains on the roadside. “there is no help from the government whatsoever. we have made a makeshift cremation site at the park in the vicinity. now that is also incapacitated, and we have started to cremate in the parking lot. i wouldn’t be surprised when even crematoriums would start turning away people,” he says. he claims many deaths are going unaccounted for, especially in cases where people are dying at home while they are quarantined. “there is a gross underreporting of the number of deaths. casualties are at least ten times more than the official figure being reported by the government. there is no record or digital footprint of people who never got tested or were hospitalised, and have succumbed to the virus at their homes. people are dying left, right and centre,” mr singh adds. crematoriums are melting: calling it one of the grimmest times in india’s history, mr p patel, a worker at the kurukshetra crematorium in prime minister narendra modi’s home turf gujarat says that last week, the chimney at the site melted as a result of overheating caused by round the clock cremations in the gas furnaces at the premises. “chimneys are getting overheated because they aren’t getting time to cool down. last year around this time, we got a maximum of 25 bodies at the height of the wave, now we are receiving over 100 bodies in a day. it's that bad,” he says. civilians stepping up to help: as many struggle after testing positive, those still safe are striving to help others. samir singh, the chairman and managing director of the delhi-based sikh chamber of commerce has set up a helpline service with a help of over 75 volunteers. “we have set up a helpline service through which we are helping people to locate hospitals which have oxygen supplies, critical care beds and we are also sending ambulances to people in need,” he says. mr singh says people are reaching out to him and his team through phone, whatsapp groups and social media or word of mouth. “they contact us from far and wide and we ensure that patients are connected with providers. we do not randomly provide them with contacts, but we verify them to ensure that if they are claiming to have oxygen cylinders, its not a hoax because patients or their families don’t have time to do this spadework,” the 42-year-old says. indian australians doing their bit: devastated by the news trickling in from india, brisbane-based karanpreet singh is raising funds for people battling the virus in india. the 30-year-old father of two says funds raised would be sent to a registered not for profit group in punjab that will be using the money to buy oxygen concentrators. “the idea is to help. we are sitting miles away from our families and loved ones. at this point, almost every household is impacted be it physically, emotionally, or financially. i know people are sceptical to donate, but i’d say so your bit in whichever way you can,” mr singh says. click on the player above to listen to the interview. people in australia must stay at least 1.5 meters away from others.  find out what restrictions are in

hammersmith bridge: bridge of sighs and a shameful collective catalogue of failure. clemmie watkins used to have a 10-minute walk to school across . since september, it has become a 40-minute bike ride via  on roads plagued by speeding drivers and riverside paths that flood when the thames rises. on winter nights, even adults avoid her unlit route home across dukes meadows, a haunt of muggers and doggers. on wednesday the 13-year-old slipped and fell crossing a wet barnes bridge, cutting herself and ruining her school skirt. “it’s really annoying,” she said. “if it floods it’s so much longer in the rain. it’s not good.” by hammersmith and fulham council when cracks were detected in its pedestals. the crossing was kept open to pedestrians and cyclists until august last year, but the cracks widened. since then, the effect on  has been “catastrophic”, . about 4,000 vehicles a day divert via her putney constituency. even at 7am, the already polluted approaches to putney bridge, the nearest alternative crossing, are gridlocked. the inability to reopen the bridge has made london a laughing stock. politicians blame each other while residents despair. ms anderson describes it as an “international embarrassment”. it has even made the new york times. on september 9 last year, transport secretary , accompanied by tory mayoral candidate shaun bailey, visited the bridge. in a video, mr shapps vowed to “take control” and “get it fixed and reopened”. . yesterday it met for the 15th time. the taskforce includes representatives from transport for london and heidi alexander, sadiq khan’s deputy mayor for transport. but mr khan said this week that the taskforce had been little more than a “talking shop to kick the can down the road”. clemmie’s mother, julia watkins, a member of the hammersmith bridge sos residents’ group, agrees. “you can’t walk over a taskforce,” she said. “they have done nothing. they were meant to be knocking heads together. baroness vere points the finger at hammersmith and fulham council. the council points the finger at grant shapps.” a resident survey found some feeling suicidal because of the closure. almost nine in 10 said they had suffered worse mental health. the apolitical hammersmith society, in a letter to the prime minister, said: “the communities on both sides of the river are unified in their anger, their disappointment and their despair.” there is a growing acknowledgement that only the government has the financial might to break the deadlock. the council owns the bridge but cannot afford the £141 million restoration bill. mr shapps wants the council to pay half the bill.  has provided about £20 million for investigations and design work, including £4 million for a temporary ferry and repairs from a government covid bail-out last year. “the government should be able to break this deadlock,” ms watkins said. “they could have straightaway funded a temporary pedestrian and cycling bridge. instead they went for this ludicrous ferry. it’s completely inadequate.” even the ferry has been delayed. an initial plan was to have it start operating last autumn. uber boat by thames clippers has won the contract but two temporary piers have yet to be constructed. residents fear services may not start until november. “our contract is to have it running by the beginning of october, but we are in negotiations with tfl to accelerate that,” said a spokesman for beckett rankine, which will design the piers. “tfl would like it ready at the start of september, but there are a lot of things that have to go right. normally it would take a year to build a new pier.” the contract between tfl and thames clippers is for a minimum of 12 months, to a maximum of five years. adults will be charged £ per crossing, though children will travel free. there will be two ferries, with a third as back-up. the crossing will take 90 seconds, with a boat every five to seven minutes in peak hours. “it will be a huge improvement for the residents,” the beckett rankine spokesman said. “it will be a very slick service. thames clippers know what they are doing.” the source added: “it’s a lot cheaper than a temporary bridge.” the council’s preferred option is a “double decker” bridge. designed by architects foster + partners and specialist bridge engineers cowi, it would cost about £100 million — £41 million less than fully restoring the existing bridge. this could allow the bridge to reopen to pedestrians and cyclists in summer next year, and to drivers two months later — four years earlier than otherwise planned. but motorists would face an estimated £3 toll. the other hope for a “quick win” rests with engineers who have analysed the structural integrity of the pedestals. it may be the case that the ironwork has stabilised and the bridge could be safe to reopen to pedestrians and cyclists. the engineers’ report was submitted to the dft three weeks ago. but sources say that “further engineering analysis and checks need to be completed” — and this could take a further three months. behind the scenes there is concern about safety. the government wants the council to retain liability should anything go wrong. residents are furious at the thought that a “risk-averse culture” could be used as an excuse to keep the bridge closed. “on that basis, politicians should close every bridge in the country,” one said, noting that teenagers continue to climb the railings to cross the bridge at night and use it as a skateboard park. “if they continue to do that after the engineers’ report shows it’s safe, that is just despicable. they’re ruining people’s lives.” the key date is when the clocks go back in october, when the thousands a day who follow clemmie’s route risk being stranded on the wrong side of the river. michelle coulter, another member of hammersmith bridge sos, whose daughters iris, 16, and lana, 13, also attend school in hammersmith, said children were often unable to board the replacement buses. under covid rules, the single-deckers can only carry 14 passengers. “since august it’s become so stressful, i cannot tell you,” she said. “my youngest finishes school at 4pm. in winter she was getting home at , sometimes 6pm. that was by bus.” mr khan accuses the government of “dither and delay” and failing to honour promises made before the 2019 general election. the council submitted its double-decker bridge proposal in february, but it is regarded by the dft to be lacking detail. two weeks ago, minister rachel maclean accused the council of wearing “gold-tinted lenses” and said a “blank cheque” would not be forthcoming. the dft said it could not comment due to pre-election purdah restrictions. sadiq khan (lab) keen to have the bridge reopened to pedestrians and cyclists if engineers find the structure safe but says the bridge will only fully reopen to vehicles when the government covers the bulk of the cost. a tfl-funded ferry service is due to start in the autumn. shaun bailey (con) promises to make the ferry free, build a temporary road bridge and fully repair the existing bridge, which he would rename the prince philip bridge. says it is essential the bridge can carry vehicles and would not impose a toll on motorists. says tfl should have funded the full repairs as soon as the bridge closed in 2019. he would fund his ideas by establishing a tfl investment fund. sian berry (green) believes the department for transport should provide “at least the majority of the costs” of repairing the bridge, and wants a date to be set for the reopening of the bridge for walking and cycling. luisa porritt (lib dem) “the government is the only body with the funds to foot the bill. the mayor could make a bigger contribution if the £2 billion silvertown tunnel road project was axed.”

lucea primary school fighting back challenges caused. the lucea primary school, which provided educational instruction to thousands of students from across hanover and adjacent parishes, is fighting back the the challenges brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.  principal of the 62-year-old institution, yazmin anderson jackson, says the students and staff have embraced the changes that have transformed the modalities of lessons that are delivered and how stakeholders interact with each other. students preparing for the grade six primary exit profile (pep) ability test were given an opportunity to have face-to-face classes between february 1, 2021 and march 18, 2021. however, the spike in covid-19 cases in the parish has forced classes to return online. grade six social studies teacher francena black is highly motivated and hopes to pass on her enthusiasm to her students. black, who is faced with the daily challenges of keeping her students motivated, said being online requires new approaches to lesson delivery. she has incorporated different modalities to maintain her students' interest. one such method is through the use of different resource persons to teach subjects in their areas of expertise. “we find that it really gets them engaged. having [different resource persons] throughout the day, we find that this makes a great difference,” black said, citing “guest teachers” from the forestry department, the hanover municipal corporation and the jamaica information service . the school, which had its genesis in an old soldier barracks near the seaside, is currently located in malcolm heights, which overlooks the aquamarine waters of lucea harbour. at present, there are more than 625 students on roll and 31 teachers on staff. lucea primary is propelled by the vision of excellence for all. in light of this, programmes are implemented to help students become well rounded. the motto, 'soaring high on integrity', alludes to that. anderson jackson is proud to note that students have earned scholarships due to their high academic performance. “over the years, we have excellent performances at the jcdc festival, winning many gold medals as well as silver medals in dance, music and speech,” she said. “students are also involved in sports and have been crowned parish champions in cricket and football,” anderson jackson notes, pointing out that the school has showcased its talents in spanish and 4-h competitions and continues to provide these avenues for self-expression and development for its students. she said that covid-19 has forced the school to use the google suite platform, and “we have been coping quite well” despite the challenges of poor internet connectivity in some areas, loss of electricity occasionally and the lack of devices for some students, anderson jackson is optimistic that her school community will continue to rise. “our highly trained staff goes beyond the call of duty to ensure that students are catered for at all levels and that the school lives up to its mission to provide a system which secures quality holistic education for all students,” she told jis news. now you can read the jamaica observer epaper anytime, anywhere. the jamaica observer epaper is available to you at home or at work, and is the same edition as the printed copy available at -login

explorationdgo gold is hoping it has created a strategic investment model that will reinvigorate gold exploration in australia. picture: bloombergdamon kitneyvictorian business editor6:42pm april 25, 2021melbourne investment banker bruce parncutt calls his latest plaything a “gold discovery company”.neither an explorer nor a miner, the asx-listed dgo gold — of which mr parncutt has been an executive director for the past year — is looking to carve out a unique niche in the australian gold  game plan is to make strategic equity investments in west australian brownfield gold discoveries, bankroll themwith additional capital and combine them with its own pursuit of largely-ignored exploration  parncutt said he hopes dgo has created a model that can reinvigorate gold exploration in australia.“gold is our fourth largest export so the industry is pretty important for the nation. we do the mining part well but i’m not so sure we do the exploration part well. especially the brownfields guys who need to get their resource to some scale,” he said. “most junior explorers find a piece of ground and they raise the capital and explore. we think we are adding intelligent value to that process.” dgo is also a unique human story, combining the skills of a career investment banker and former boss of mcintosh securities in mr parncutt, with the exploration expertise of one of the resource sector’s most famed geologists, ed  joseph gutnick’s exploration director in the late 1980s and early 1990s, mr eshuys led the teams that discovered the plutonic, bronzewing and jundee gold deposits and the cawse nickel deposit. before those triumphs, mr eshuys also had involvement in the maggie hays and mariners nickel discoveries in the  is now dgo gold’s executive chairman and is working closely with mr parncutt — who has been on the board since 2018 — and dgo’s management team to develop two sizeable wa gold resources and to explore for more.“we do bring together a unique set of skills. it is all very well to have the money but to apply that you need the technical skills” mr eshuys said.“bruce and i do debate between ourselves our respective points of view and invariably come up with a consensus. that has led us to a disciplined approach to take dgo from where it was to where it is now.”dgo gold directors ed eshuys and bruce  gold initially evaluated 100 gold explorers and their projects. ten asx juniors made the shortlist before dgo narrowed it down to two, taking strategic stakes in booming pilbara gold explorer de grey mining and leonora gold explorer ntm  has a string of major greenfield exploration projects of its own being drilled, including on prime south australian ground owned by junior explorer investigator resources as the first stage to earning an 80 per cent stake in the latter’s pernatty copper project. dgo also has a 40 per cent interest in yilgarn exploration ventures, which is drilling in the leonora district of western australia.“one of the critical things we found when we were talking to all the juniors was that they didn’t understand the need to have at least 3 million ounces to have something of meaningful scale,” mr eshuys said.“part of our discussions with these companies was about raising sufficient funds to do the job properly. that is where de grey came to the party. they did understand they needed to raise more money and they did that.”the strategy has seen dgo gold shares soar from just 17c four years ago, and $ last year when mr parncutt became an executive, to close on friday at $ soared over $4 in september last year on the back of the coronavirus-fuelled surge in the gold price, which saw it spike to $us2056 per ounce last  gold prices have trended lower since the start of 2021 amid rising us treasury yields and an increasingly positive outlook for the global economic recovery, the dgo share price has held  now owns 16 per cent of de grey, which is drilling out a significant pilbara gold discovery. it also has board representation and has supported de grey’s capital raisings, including a $25m round last september.“de grey is in a unique position in terms of its pilbara land position. that is one of our key elements when we invest and explore,” mr eshuys  the merger late last year of ntm gold with dacian gold, dgo will now emerge with a 10 per cent stake in  the $25m raised last september, $8m was also pegged for greenfield  value of dgo’s stake in de grey covers its $225m market capitalisation, meaning the market is currently attributing no value to dgo’s substantial exploration  has attracted some big name investors, including stockbroking veteran tom klinger, one of christopher skase’s biggest backers through the 1980s and another former mcintosh managing director. others are former stockbroking resources turned private equity fund adviser peter woodford, the rich-lister costa family member robert costa and regal funds management.
europe oil firms post huge profits as crude rallies. paris—european oil majors have posted strong quarterly profits as a recovery in crude prices fueled their rebound from the coronavirus crisis. france’s total, britain’s bp, anglo-dutch group shell and spain’s repsol have this week posted $14.5 billion in first-quarter profits between them. at the same time, the companies renewed their commitments to investing in renewable energies. it’s a huge turnaround from last year, when global lockdowns decimated economic activity and oil prices fell off a cliff, taking the energy giants’ balance sheets with them. royal dutch shell led the way posting a $5.7-billion (4.7 billion euros) net profit in the first quarter on thursday following a loss in the same period last year. bp also returned to the black, booking a $4.7-billion profit while total added $3.3 billion, even outstripping pre-pandemic levels. repsol, browbeaten by two years of huge losses, scored a $783-million gain. the results are a boon for the majors, who made tens of billions of cumulative losses last year as the health pandemic took hold and prices collapsed. prices have returned to pre-pandemic since them, exceeding $60 per barrel. goldman sachs analyst see prices rising to $80 in the next six months. “these are profitable price levels and it is not a surprise that oil companies have published strong results,” said michael tamvakis, commodity economics professor at london’s business school. oil prices should remain strong as the driving and flying season restarts later in may and june, tamvakis said. “so for now, oil companies have weathered the storm,” he said. the profits are also a reflection that some companies are slimming down their staff levels. shell decided to ax more than 10 percent of its global workforce, or up to 9,000 jobs. shell, like some of its peers, has also been shedding assets. that gave it a $1.4-billion boost in the first quarter.   “shell has made a strong start to 2021, generating over $8 billion of cash in the quarter,” said chief executive ben van beurden. he added that shell’s model is ideally positioned to benefit from recovering demand. “fortunately for investors these latest results come without the drama seen this time last year when shell cut its dividend for the first time since the second world war,” said keith bowman, equity analyst at interactive investor. shell this time around increased its dividend payout by about 4.0 percent compared with the final quarter of last year.

global gold demand, first quarter near low level for the first time in 13 years investor sales. [london, 29th reuters] --global gold demand in the first quarter of this year has remained near its lowest level since 2008, according to a quarterly report released by the world gold council (wgc), an international gold research institute. it was. while asian consumer buying has returned, investor sales have expanded in europe and north america. last year, as the spread of the new coronavirus hit the global economy, investors were increasingly buying gold as a safe haven. at the same time, lockdowns to curb the spread of infection have slowed sales of gold jewelery, gold nuggets and gold coins in china and india, which are normally the two biggest consumers. as the global economy recovers, this trend is now reversing, with investors shrinking their holdings and asian consumer buying returning. according to the wgc, global gold demand from january to march this year was 815.7 tons, a slight increase from 813.7 tons in the previous quarter. however, it decreased by 23% year-on-year. consumer demand in china was 286.4 tonnes, the highest level since the first quarter of 2017. on the other hand, exchange-traded fund (etf) gold holdings fell by 177.9 tons, the largest decline since the fourth quarter of 2013. due to the sale by etf, the gold price fell from the record high of 1 ounce = $  in august last year to around $ 1,700 in march. according to the wgc, this helped boost demand for asians. in april, etf sales slowed sharply and gold prices picked up towards $ 1800. wgc analyst christian gopaul said consumers and investors&#39; demand for gold this year is likely to remain resilient, albeit below its recent peak. gold purchased by the central bank in the first quarter was 95.5 tonnes, the highest level since the second quarter of last year. however, it was well below the typical level seen in 2018 and 2019. reuters

under-supplied metal palladium races past $3,000/oz for first time. meanwhile, spot gold was down 0.2% at $1,769 per ounce by 0910 gmt.       palladium pierced the $3,000 an ounce high for the first time on friday, powered by persistent concerns about short supply of the metal used primarily for emissions-controlling devices in automobiles. palladium was last up 1% to $2, per ounce, after hitting an all-time high of $3, it was on track to post a monthly gain as well. "palladium is in a structural deficit since 10 years. we have seen above ground inventories falling to very low levels, and now the price gives a signal to investors still holding it," ubs analyst giovanni staunovo said. "the commodity ... comes with very low trading volume so it can be very illiquid and this is making the moves even more crazy. this rally can continue, particularly if car sales start to improve going forward." demand from the auto industry is rising and expected to climb further as a semiconductor chip shortage that has curtailed vehicle production eases later this year. but commerzbank analyst carsten fritsch said prices are unlikely to see a sustained run above $3,000, with substitution likely to bring prices down as the year goes on. "at this level more and more car manufacturers will think about substitution (of palladium for platinum)." a shift to electric vehicles may also eventually erode palladium demand, although tightening environmental rules have forced carmakers to use more and more palladium in their gasoline engines in recent years. meanwhile, spot gold was down 0.2% at $1,769 per ounce by 0910 gmt.  gold futures were steady at $1, data showed on thursday that  economic growth accelerated in the first quarter. separately, a report from the  labor department showed a dip in initial claims for state unemployment benefits. silver fell 0.5% to $ per ounce, though was poised for an over 6% monthly gain - its biggest since last december. platinum was up 0.7% at $1,206.   (reporting by nallur sethuraman in bengaluru, additional reporting by peter hobson in london; editing by emelia sithole-matarise)    dear reader,  business standard has always strived hard to provide up-to-date information and commentary on developments that are of interest to you and have wider political and economic implications for the country and the world.  your encouragement and constant feedback on how to improve our offering have only made our resolve and commitment to these ideals stronger.  even during these difficult times arising out of covid-19, we continue to remain committed to keeping you informed and updated with credible news, authoritative views and incisive commentary on topical issues of relevance. we, however, have a request. as we battle the economic impact of the pandemic, we need your support even more, so that we can continue to offer you more quality content. our subscription model has seen an encouraging response from many of you, who have subscribed to our online content. more subscription to our online content can only help us achieve the goals of offering you even better and more relevant content. we believe in free, fair and credible journalism. your support through more subscriptions can help us practise the journalism to which we are committed. support quality journalism and subscribe to business standard . digital editor

apple faces eu antitrust action for 'abusing' music. apple faces eu antitrust action for 'abusing' music streaming dominance by: thestreet | april 30, 2021 • 'by setting strict rules on the app store that disadvantage competing music streaming services, apple deprives users of cheaper music streaming choices and distorts competition,' the eu says. apple inc. (aapl) shares slipped lower friday after european union officials charged the world's biggest tech company with abusing its dominance in the music streaming market. the eu's competition commission said apple uses restrictions within its app store that prevent rivals from informing iphone and ipad users of cheaper alternatives to apple music while charging higher fees that distort competition. eu rules allow for fines that could reach 10% of apple's annual sales, which hit $275.5 billion in the fiscal year ending on september 28. the commission levied a record $5 billion fine against goggle parent alphabet (googl) - get report in 2018 following a lengthy investigation into contracts that tie makers of android-operated smartphones to the exclusive sale of its apps. “app stores play a central role in today's digital economy. we can now do our shopping, access news, music or movies via apps instead of visiting websites," said the commission's executive vice president, margrethe vestager. "our preliminary finding is that apple is a gatekeeper to users of iphones and ipads via the app store. with apple music, apple also competes with music streaming providers." "by setting strict rules on the app store that disadvantage competing music streaming services, apple deprives users of cheaper music streaming choices and distorts competition," she added. "this is done by charging high commission fees on each transaction in the app store for rivals and by forbidding them from informing their customers of alternative subscription options.” apple shares were marked 0.7% lower in early trading following the eu charges and changing hands at $ each. read full story »»» discovergold

$1.3 billion valuation as non bank moves closer to ipo. pepper money , one of the biggest non bank lenders in australia, has moved a step closer to their ipo, launching a float that seeks to raise $450m at $ per share. the non bank lender would be valued at $1.3 billion by such a move. if it were to happen, it would represent the biggest australian ipo of 2021 so far. the deal is backed by credit suisse, goldman sachs and rbc capital markets. pepper were previously listed on the asx. their ipo in 2015 saw them valued at $470m, which grew to $600m within a day of trading. it was removed from the stock market in 2017 after us-based investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts (kkr) bought it outright. plans were released at the beginning of last year to return pepper to the market with a $1 billion valuation, but they were put on hold by fluctuations in market conditions brought about by the covid-19 pandemic. as confidence returns and the home loan sector, which provides a substantial part of pepper’s assets, remains booming, the time seems right for kkr to bring them back to market.

unanswered points launch vikings basketball to 90-61 win over grizzlies. by jonathan andrade  for the signal   valencia high rattled off 22 unanswered points in the third quarter against golden valley tuesday night at home to vault the vikings to a 90-61 foothill league victory.  “we really got on them at the half and challenged them to come out and give some intensity,” said bill bedgood, valencia’s head basketball coach.  valencia senior noah veluzat, who guided the vikings (2-1 overall) with a triple-double of 25 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds, said he and his teammates weren’t satisfied with a seven-point halftime lead after leading golden valley (0-3) by as many as 14 points in the first quarter.  “one thing that’s great about our team is that we can all take criticism from each other,” said veluzat, the reigning foothill league player of the year. “we adapt and we do better. that’s just the adjustment we made at half time.”  valencia’s stingy defense held golden valley scoreless for the first six minutes of the second half. grizzlies sophomore jonathan hakim finally stopped the bleeding with 1:16 left in the third quarter when he made a layup while drawing the foul, ultimately converting the three-point play.   “i thought we got good shots in the third,” said golden valley head coach chris printz. “they just didn’t go. sometimes that happens, especially on the road.”  golden valley, which was powered by senior luka marich and his game-high 30 points, used a strong second quarter to draw within seven at the break.  “we were moving the ball and playing good defense,” marich said of his team’s performance in the first half. “they (valencia) just hit shots in the second half and we couldn’t respond with our own.”  valencia senior ryan hoffman was hot from beyond the arc, nailing seven threes throughout his 25-point performance. kai davis, a sophomore who missed last season with an injury, chipped in 16 points. freshman zach bauman sank a pair of threes late in the fourth quarter.  veluzat had high praise for bauman.  “he’s going to be a big-time player,” the senior said of the freshman. “he’ll be a foothill league mvp by his junior year, and probably repeat (as a senior).”  printz said he was proud to see the grizzlies continue to battle despite the late deficit.  “even at the end, they weren’t going to back down,” the coach said. “that’ll help build the foundation for success in the future…we can see the progress that’s been made already and where things are going. we’re proud of that.”  golden valley will try to pick up its first win of the season at 6:30  friday at saugus.  while bedgood was pleased his team came away with the victory tuesday night, he admits the vikings have some room to grow if they plan on defending the foothill crown.  “it’s just a matter of our guys understanding that every day we’re either getting better or we’re getting worse,” the coach said. “if we continue to get better every day, i think we’re going to be right in the mix.”  valencia next plays host to hart at 6:30  friday. the post unanswered points launch vikings basketball to 90-61 win over grizzlies appeared first on santa clarita valley signal .

produzierte das unternehmen  unzen gold, was einen anstieg von 3 % gegenüber dem vorangegangenen märz-quartal und einen rückgang von 16 % gegenüber dem vorquartal darstellt. der anstieg der produktion im vergleich zum ersten quartal 2020 spiegelt die stärkere leistung von haile wider, die teilweise durch die geringere produktion der neuseeländischen betriebe ausgeglichen wurde. die geringere produktion im quartalsvergleich ist in erster linie auf neuseeland zurückzuführen, wo eine mühlenstörung macraes beeinträchtigte und waihi wie geplant eine reduzierte verarbeitungskampagne durchführte. haile war ebenfalls rückläufig, wobei ein höherer durchschnittlicher einsatzgrad durch einen geringeren mühlendurchsatz ausgeglichen wurde. didipio blieb in einem zustand der betriebsbereitschaft. die steigenden konsolidierten cash-kosten in höhe von 800 $ pro unze und die all-in sustaining costs ("aisc") in höhe von  $ pro verkaufter unze spiegeln die geringere produktion und die im vergleich zum vorquartal höheren kapitalisierten vorabstriche wider, insbesondere bei macraes. das unternehmen verzeichnete im ersten quartal einen goldabsatz von  unzen, was einem rückgang von 14 % gegenüber dem vierten quartal 2020 entspricht. in haile produzierte der betrieb im ersten quartal  unzen gold, 51 % mehr als im vorangegangenen märz-quartal, was auf eine verbesserte produktivität beim abbau zurückzuführen ist. die goldproduktion und der mühlendurchsatz waren im ersten quartal um 10 % bzw. 20 % niedriger als im vorquartal, was auf probleme mit dem fluss des gesättigten saprolitischen erzes zur anlage (die im laufe des quartals angegangen und behoben wurden) und einen geplanten dreitägigen anlagenstillstand zurückzuführen ist. gleichzeitig stiegen die gesamten bergbaubewegungen um 24 % bzw. 7 % gegenüber dem vorangegangenen märz-quartal bzw. dem vierten quartal 2020, und der betrieb erreichte im quartal einen rekord an gesamtbewegungen. der anstieg der kosten für den abbau und das mahlen bei haile im ersten quartal spiegelt den geringeren anlagendurchsatz, die auswirkungen von einmaligen kosten im zusammenhang mit der abschwächung von anlagenstörungen durch gesättigtes erz und in geringerem maße den zusätzlichen personalbestand zur bewältigung der covid-19-bedingten abwesenheit der belegschaft wider. die bestätigten covid-19-fälle am standort stiegen von 63 am ende des jahres 2020 auf 111 im ersten quartal. das unternehmen geht weiterhin davon aus, dass haile  bis  unzen gold bei aisc des standorts von 950 bis  $ pro verkaufter unze produzieren wird, und weist darauf hin, dass der ausblick durch zusätzliche herausforderungen im zusammenhang mit der covid-19-pandemie beeinträchtigt werden könnte. in neuseeland produzierte waihi im ersten quartal  unzen gold. die aktivitäten bei waihi konzentrierten sich in erster linie auf die erschließung von martha underground, einschließlich der fertigstellung von  metern untertageerschließung im ersten quartal. darüber hinaus meldete das unternehmen in verbindung mit der abgeschlossenen machbarkeitsstudie die erste reserve von  unzen gold bei martha underground ("mug"). die erschließung von mug verläuft nach plan, sodass die kontinuierliche produktion im juni nach dem austausch der bestehenden sag-mühle von waihi beginnen wird. die prognose für das gesamtjahr 2021 bei waihi bleibt unverändert. die produktion von macraes ging im quartalsvergleich um 19 % und im vergleich zum vorangegangenen quartal im märz um 12 % zurück, was in erster linie auf eine einmalige unterbrechung des mühlenbetriebs aufgrund eines ausfalls des mühlenmotors anfang februar zurückzuführen ist. darüber hinaus erforderten außergewöhnlich starke regenfälle im januar eine zweiwöchige evakuierung von frasers underground und verhinderten vorübergehend den zugang zum erzabbau in den tagebauen; daher wurden die abbauanstrengungen auf einen verstärkten abbau von abraum und vorabbau im tagebau deepdell north gerichtet. die höheren aisc im ersten quartal spiegeln den geringeren mühlendurchsatz und die erhöhten investitionen in den unterhalt und die vorabbauaktivitäten wider. die gesamtjahresprognose für macraes bleibt unverändert. das unternehmen geht davon aus, dass der mühlenmotor im zweiten quartal ersetzt wird, während gleichzeitig der autoklav planmäßig neu gemauert wird. didipio befindet sich weiterhin im zustand der betriebsbereitschaft. im ersten quartal gab es keine produktion, da der betrieb aufgrund der anhaltenden blockade der zufahrtsstraße eingestellt wurde. das unternehmen verbuchte 4,5 mio. $ an holdingkosten als teil der konsolidierten corporate general and administration, die sich auf die aufrechterhaltung von didipio im zustand der betriebsbereitschaft beziehen. dies steht im vergleich zu $9,1 mio. im vorherigen quartal. das financial or technical assistance agreement ("ftaa") muss derzeit noch vom philippinischen department of environment and natural resources ("denr") an das office of the president rückbestätigt werden. das unternehmen ist nicht in der lage, einen konkreten zeitplan für den abschluss der erneuerung zu nennen. die ausbreitung und das effektive management von covid-19 auf den philippinen kann ein faktor für den zeitplan für die wiederaufnahme des normalen betriebs sein, der bis zu 12 monate dauern könnte. seit märz 2020 wurden in didipio neun positive covid-19-fälle verwaltet, von denen vier im ersten quartal 2021 auftraten. finanzen in den drei monaten, die am 31. märz 2021 endeten, erwirtschaftete das unternehmen einen umsatz von 148,9 mio. $ und ein bereinigtes ebitda von 66,5 mio. $, was 11 % bzw. 6 % unter dem des vorquartals liegt, was auf geringere goldverkäufe aus neuseeland zurückzuführen ist. im ersten quartal stiegen der umsatz und das bereinigte ebitda um 8 % bzw. 34 % gegenüber dem vorangegangenen märz-quartal, was auf eine verbesserte leistung von haile und einen um 18 % höheren durchschnittlichen goldpreis in diesem zeitraum zurückzuführen ist. der bereinigte nettogewinn (ohne didipio-buchhaltungskosten) betrug im ersten quartal 21,8 mio. $ oder 0,03$ pro aktie und profitierte von der verbesserung des durchschnittlichen goldpreises gegenüber dem vorjahresquartal. der operative cashflow lag im ersten quartal bei 47,6 mio. $, ein anstieg im vergleich zum vorquartal, der auf den stärkeren goldpreis und niedrigere buchhaltungskosten für didipio zurückzuführen ist. dies wurde teilweise durch bewegungen des betriebskapitals aufgrund einer erhöhung der lagerbestände bei haile ausgeglichen. der voll verwässerte cashflow pro aktie vor working-capital-bewegungen betrug $0,09 pro aktie. der investitions-cashflow in höhe von 71,9 mio. $ im ersten quartal erhöhte sich im vergleich zum vorquartal aufgrund höherer investitionsausgaben bei haile für die erweiterung des abfalllagers und der vorabstreifungsaktivitäten bei macraes sowie der laufenden investitionen in die erschließung des martha undergrounds bei waihi. zum 31. märz 2021 belief sich der bargeldbestand des unternehmens auf 145,5 mio. us-dollar und 50,0 mio. us-dollar blieben im rahmen der kreditfazilität nicht in anspruch genommen. vorankündigungspolitik das unternehmen gibt ferner bekannt, dass das board of directors eine vorankündigungsrichtlinie ("richtlinie") für das unternehmen verabschiedet hat. die richtlinie legt einen rahmen für die nominierung von direktoren im zusammenhang mit einer aktionärsversammlung fest und steht im einklang mit bewährten

information in bezug auf die nominierung von direktoren erhalten, um fundierte entscheidungen zu treffen . das unternehmen wird die ratifizierung der richtlinie durch einen ordentlichen beschluss der

eu accuses apple of breaking antitrust law over music streaming. london (cnn business)european regulators have accused apple galloway: to oxygenate economy, break up big tech margrethe vestager, the european commission's top antitrust official, said friday that the bloc had reached the "preliminary conclusion" that apple is in breach of competition law. the company's music service competes with streaming services "but apple charges high commission fees on rivals in the app store and forbids them to inform of alternative subscription options," she said in a post on twitter. "consumers losing out," she added. the european commission launched an investigation of apple last june following a complaint from music and podcast giant ify (). the commission said in a statement friday that it "takes issue with" the mandatory use of apple's in-app purchase system imposed on streaming services. it said it is "also concerned that apple applies certain restrictions on app developers preventing them from informing iphone and ipad users of alternative, cheaper purchasing possibilities." "by setting strict rules on the app store that disadvantage competing music streaming services, apple deprives users of cheaper music streaming choices and distorts competition," vestager said in the statement. ify ceo daniel ek praised the commission, saying in a twitter post that "fairness is the key to competition.' "we are one step closer to creating a level playing field, which is so important for the entire ecosystem of european developers," he added. the accusations are the latest development in a series of high profile battles between the european union and big tech companies that have resulted in hefty penalties. apple could eventually be fined up to 10% of its annual sales if found in violation of competition rules. apple said in a statement on friday that the "commission's argument on ify's behalf is the opposite of fair competition." "at the core of this case is ify's demand they should be able to advertise alternative deals on their ios app, a practice that no store in the world allows. once again, they want all the benefits of the app store but don't think they should have to pay anything for that," it added. margrethe vestager speaks during a press conference on artificial intelligence in april, 2021. europe has turned itself into the cop on the big tech beat, repeatedly enforcing its rules and hitting the industry's top american companies with huge fines. the european union last year unveiled formal antitrust charges against amazon (amzn) for abusing its dominance in online shopping. google (googl) has also been hit with a series of antitrust investigations and penalties. last year, apple won an appeal against a landmark 2016 ruling from the european commission that it owed ireland €13 billion ($14.9 billion) in taxes. the european union's second highest court ruled that the commission had not proven that the company had received illegal state aid from ireland through favorable tax agreements. vestager has appealed the decision. — hadas gold contributed to this article.
inside paul simon’s catalog sale: at $250 million, it’s one of music’s biggest. paul simon’s song catalog sold for approximately $250 million last month, according to sources familiar with the transaction, making it one of the largest music publishing deals of the past two years.  simon sold hundreds of compositions including “the sound of silence” and “you can call me al” to sony/atv last month for an undisclosed sum. the sale follows a string of cash-outs by ageing songwriters including neil young, stevie nicks and bob dylan, who are motivated by the threat of rising capital gains taxes and a desire to get their catalogs in the hands of managers that can oversee them for the future.  a spokesperson for sony/atv declined to comment on the terms of the deal. representatives for simon did not return requests for comment. simon’s output spans seven decades and has produced numerous hits and 16 grammy awards, including three album of the year awards for bridge over troubled water , still crazy after all these years and graceland . he released 14 solo albums, including chart-toppers like rhythm of the saints and even served as the sole songwriter, with very few exceptions, for simon and garfunkel. both stars recorded for sony’s columbia records and were two of the label’s top stars going back to the 1960s. the label will continue to own the master recordings for both. unlike those recordings, which are typically owned by the labels that produce and distribute them, the copyrights of song compositions default to the songwriters, who often share those rights with a publishing company. those rights earn money in a number of ways. in addition to royalties from streaming and radio plays, rights holders collect money from public usage of songs in locations ranging from football stadiums to local dive bars. they also can earn seven-figure sums for use in commercials, television and film.  simon also has not shied away from monetizing his music, including providing the soundtrack for the 1967 film the graduate , which would go on to gross nearly $105 million in north america, or more than $800 million when accounting for inflation. recently, “homeward bound” was featured in an ad for real estate firm coldwell banker, while "the sound of silence" provided the soundtrack for a volkswagen spot. that kind of steady, diversified stream of income has made publishing catalogs attractive to investors looking for low-risk alternatives to bonds while interest rates remain rock-bottom. for classic artists, the increased interest in catalogs has become a goldmine and simon, like dylan, held fast to his songwriting credits over the years and almost always wrote alone. the pair of music legends could not have picked a better time to cash out, as investors like kkr, round hill music and hipgnosis duke it out with traditional labels like sony, universal and warner music group for top artists’ songbooks. that battle has pushed up multiples for top-tier catalogs from about 9 times the amount of annual royalties a decade ago to triple that today. dylan, young and nicks all sold their catalogues last year for 25-28 times annual revenue, while sources say simon sold for almost 30 times annual revenue, as sony sought to avoid the loss of another top songwriter, after dylan snubbed the company by selling his catalog to universal music group’s publishing company in december.  the 79-year-old simon still commands a solid chunk of music streams, with music from his solo career and simon and garfukel getting nearly 18 million monthly listeners on spotify, compared with 10 million for dylan and more than 30 million for current pop stars like beyoncé and harry styles. his last tour, in 2018, grossed more than $31 million, according to data from pollstar.

re: bitcoin or gold?. if you are talking about a long-term investment (20 years, 30 years) with less risk, gold is the best choice but if you wanted to earn more and with also have an absolute risk, it gonna be bitcoin. well, i don't think that people would able to wait for 20 years just to see their portfolio will grow. because as what i observe in these new generation, almost all of them are in the hurry i don't know why but they are impatient. but for me, i have to choice both of them for a better assurance, it was just like putting an eggs to 2 baskets.

can utah republicans survive an emerging sea of blue in the west?. that’s what’s at stake and why the race for utah’s next republican leader matters, outgoing utah gop chairman says share this story share all sharing options for: as surrounding states in the west continue to trend democratic, will utah remain a red stronghold? or will it eventually become overtaken in an emerging sea of blue? that’s what’s at stake for utah republicans in the race for the utah gop’s next chairperson, a position largely off the radar of a public consumed by covid-19 updates and the promise of better weather. yet when delegates make their selection from five candidates at this weekend’s state convention, it will help determine the future of their party and its influence on utah politics, said derek brown, the state gop’s outgoing chairman, who announced last month he wouldn’t be seeking another term to spend more time with his family. “anyone who is paying attention to the trends and to the numbers who is a republican should be very concerned,” brown told the deseret news in an interview this week. “the demographic and geographic trends are not boding well for republicans — both nationally and here in the state of utah.”rewind to the year 2000, when george w. bush beat al gore for president. that year, the entire western  voted red except for oregon, california, washington and purple new mexico — though new mexico tipped blue on a fraction of a percentage point. since then, “one by one we’ve had states surrounding utah that have flipped blue,” brown said. new mexico, though it voted red in 2004, flipped democratic in 2008 for former president barack obama, and has since stayed blue. other purple states like colorado and nevada have faded blue. then arizona, a state that has voted red since 2000, made the flip last year, when the state turned blue for president joe biden. “that is a democratic shift in the western  that does not bode well for republicans, and we have not done a good job nationally of (addressing it),” brown said, describing the difficulties republicans have had engaging millennial voters and unifying around their platform. outgoing utah gop chairman derek brown looks over county signs at the party’s headquarters in salt lake city on wednesday, april 28, 2021. jeffrey d. allred, deseret news nate silver, the editor-in-chief of fivethirtyeight who is a well-known predictor of political elections, last year said “people underrate the chance that utah could become a swing state in another couple of cycles.” in 2017, silver told the deseret news he’s fascinated by utah because it looks and breathes like a blue state, even though it’s traditionally red. he said utah “increasingly has the markers of a blue state, meaning high education levels, big tech sector, young population. so you can kind of envision a world in eight years, 12 years, 16 years in which utah behaves more like colorado or something, right?” “and this was before covid,” brown said. add in the pandemic, which brown said has put these concerning trends for republicans on “steroids” because of the number of people moving from other states like new york or california and “flooding” utah. “the people coming here ... that may help our economy, but it will definitely have an impact on the political landscape,” brown said. so while the utah gop for decades has “had the luxury of a super majority,” brown said assuming that “luxury” will last forever could spell trouble for utah republicans. “the luxury of a super majority can also allow a party to be sloppy and unfocused and still win elections,” brown said. “my concern is we may not have that luxury in the next five to 10 years. and whether that is the case has everything to do with the party remaining strong and funded.” brown said he saw it happen in arizona last year, where he said a “weak and fractured party focused on infighting” lost in a crucial presidential year and lost a republican seat in the  senate. “my concern is whenever a party becomes weak and unfunded and unfocused and allows itself to engage in infighting, the day follows the night. the party will begin to lose elections,” he said. “and we (in utah) have not done that in the last few years. we have reversed that trend. but as a party we need to remain vigilant — or else we will go the way of our surrounding states.” outgoing utah gop chairman derek brown looks over old caucus signs that weren’t used due to covid-19 at the party’s headquarters in salt lake city on wednesday, april 28, 2021. jeffrey d. allred, deseret news utah’s gop before brown was elected in may 2019, the utah gop was plagued by inner turmoil: divided into camps by years of infighting over the controversial election law sb54 and in debt, owing more than $137,000. “they couldn’t pay their bills,” brown said. “they had just lost a number of races including a congressional seat, and the fundraising was abysmal.” in 2018, former rep. ben mcadams beat former rep. mia love and became the first democrat to win a congressional seat in utah since 2012. “fast forward two years,” brown said. “we pulled the party out of debt within a month or two. ... the party is unified in a way that it hasn’t been, notwithstanding the challenges we’ve faced. we’ve raised over $1 million. and we’ve won almost every election we’ve set out to win, including the seat in congress that we lost.” rep. burgess owens last year defeated mcadams and took back utah’s 4th congressional district seat for republicans. now, the utah gop must continue in the “positive direction” brown said. who emerges during the weekend convention to become chairperson, vice chairman, secretary and treasurer will set the future course. who will lead? “the most important thing for a party is to support the candidates and support the brand and have an organization that is well funded and organizationally sound,” brown said. “for me, this election is about are we going to continue to move that direction, or are we going to major in minor things? sometimes i think political parties can focus on internal squabbles that don’t necessarily help them win elections.” brown said he needed to remain “neutral” ahead of saturday’s convention, so he didn’t have any endorsements or anti-endorsements for the candidates vying to take his place. but brown did list some characteristics he believes the utah gop’s chairperson needs to have, including the basic ability to raise funds effectively, the ability to understand how elections are managed and won — while also having the temperament and ability to unite utah’s republicans rather than divide. unity and civility is a style of politics employed by gov. spencer cox — who successfully won his election last year and has seen upward trending approval ratings. it’s also a style that’s the opposite of the leader national and the majority of utah republicans coalesced around in 2016 and 2020 — former president donald trump. trump’s divisive and polarizing style ultimately fell short on the national level in november last year. in utah, division and polarization is not a style that’s typically successful — and not one that brown said will position utah’s gop for success. “someone who is a unifier and someone who cannot just recognize that you have people all over the political spectrum in one party, but someone who actually reaches out to all of them to bring them together is the best way forward,” brown said. “i think someone who is divisive and focused on their own personal agenda, not only will they not unify the party, but they will force anyone who differs with them from the party. “and for a state like utah that may trend blue,” brown said, “that’s exactly the opposite of what we need to do.” the candidates five candidates are running to succeed brown, and they range in backgrounds and demographics. a look at who they are provides a picture of the gop in utah. there’s tina cannon, a former morgan county gop chairwoman and morgan county councilwoman who would be the first woman to lead utah’s gop. there’s stewart peay, current chairman of the utah county republican party who’s been endorsed by gov. spencer cox and lt. gov. deidre henderson, among other legislative leaders. there’s brad baker, who at 22 is likely the youngest state party candidate in utah’s party’s history. there’s carson jorgensen, a 31-year-old sheep rancher with a passion for agriculture and public lands. and there’s scott miller, former salt lake county gop chairman who resigned amid controversy last month, but for which he has since rescinded his apology, defending himself by saying he’d been “kavanaughed.” scott miller miller, who lives in riverton and was chairman of the salt lake county gop for more than three years, made headlines last month after he was accused by multiple women within the salt lake county gop for allowing “bullying” to occur within the party. scott miller scott miller while his four opponents agreed to phone interviews with the deseret news this week for this story, miller did not accept multiple requests for an interview and only answered questions via email. after initially calling the women accusers “sore losers who failed to win their respective races” in an email last month that preempted the first media report of the accusations, miller later resigned and apologized, saying he “made a mistake with how i handled” the complaints. since then, miller’s backtracked. in an email sent to the deseret news on tuesday, miller said he had withdrawn his apology. “i stand by my actions,” he wrote “throughout the campaign, i immediately addressed any and all issues and complaints and i have documentation and witnesses to prove it. i never heard several of the complaints until it was presented in the press.” miller also wrote he’s been “kavanaughed,” comparing himself to supreme court justice brett kavanaugh, the federal judge who was accused of sexual assault from the ’80s during his 2018 confirmation hearings. “i believe certain women and others strategically timed salatious (sic) allegations against me to derail my campaign for state chair,” he wrote. “many utah republicans seem to believe in ‘guilt by accusation’ and seem intent to deny due process to the accused. this is very disturbing.” he added: “i believe we have an obligation to investigate,” miller wrote. “we need to get to the bottom of this issue. let’s have due process, a fair investigation, and let the public see the facts.” miller argues he’s the right person to lead utah’s gop, saying under his leadership the salt lake county gop “successfully turned the salt lake county council from purple to red.” he wrote he’ll keep utah from turning purple by seeking to “expand the republican tent. we expanded the tent in salt lake county. we recruited and encouraged good candidates,” saying those candidates included women, and people from diverse backgrounds. “we helped elect a greek, a doctor, and congressman burgess owens, an african american.” tina cannon cannon, 53, has 20 years of experience within the utah republican party. she served as chairwoman for the morgan county gop, as well as a state convention committee member and a state convention credentials chairwoman. she was twice elected as a morgan county councilwoman. she ran a bid last year to represent utah’s 1st congressional district, but faltered in the republican convention. tina cannon tina cannon if it’s a strong organizational structure and fundraising backbone the utah gop needs, cannon argues she’s the “only candidate in this race” that has that fundraising experience, pointing to her congressional run. it wasn’t until after brown announced he was stepping down and she started getting phone calls from supporters that cannon said she’d considered running to replace him. and then when the salt lake county gop/miller controversy hit headlines, and she said her “phone blew up.” “i was having a lot of friends in the party, particularly male friends, who were very concerned about the message this was sending and felt like it was time for another perspective,” she said. there are “very few women in republican politics in utah,” cannon said, and “we each have our stories.” but she said that story did not represent the “majority of men” in utah’s gop, noting she’s had “incredible mentors, supporters and donors.” but she worried that story wasn’t being told “and that’s sad to me.” “because when women see this, it discourages them from running,” she said. “politics is hard. politics is a blood sport. and women don’t run for the same reasons that men do. women run to do something. men run to be something.” so, cannon said she decided to “step into this chaos” — a decision she made 45 minutes before the filing deadline on april 1 — in order to “encourage good women to run.” when other women don’t see other women “who are strong enough, qualified, and win, they don’t run,” she said. “this is a difficult thing,” cannon added, “because i don’t want to run as a woman. i’m not running because i‘m a woman. i’m the best candidate. ... i have by far the most experience and the best background.” running as the only female candidate isn’t a message that will resonate with utah gop delegates, she said. “it’s about being well qualified.” at the same time, increased diversity is what the utah republican party needs as it looks to the future, cannon said. “we need to have a diversity of voices at the table because we are losing that demographic at the republican party.” stewart peay peay, 47, a lawyer who lives in alpine, was elected as chairman of the utah county gop in april 2019. by day, peay works as a partner at snell & wilmer, where he’s worked for 18 years. he also served in the utah national guard for 13 years, including a tour in iraq. stewart peay stewart peay in his two years as utah county gop chairman, peay said he spent that time “unifying utah county republicans, which is no small task.” when he first came to the post, peay said the county republicans couldn’t get along to make decisions at the executive committee level, and he attributed that as a big reason why love lost to mcadams in 2018. last year, peay said the utah county gop energized more voters and helped push owens to victory. “one of the key things i did in utah county is listen to everybody,” peay said. “i encourage all parties to bring forward their positions, then as a leadership group we figure out a resolution that works for our party. it’s not perfect for everyone, but it’s great for the party, and that’s what we need.” the emerging blue sea around utah in the west, the changing political landscape and the threat it poses to republicans’ future in utah is “why i’m running” for the statewide party chairperson position. during the past two years, peay credited miller for “getting the party back on track, and i feel like we need to stay on that track if we’re going to defend our traditional republican values and strongholds here in utah.” as utah’s population changes and as more people move in from states like california, peay said the utah republican party needs to “control its message.” “we need to explain there is so much great economic opportunity here in utah because for 40 years the utah republican party has dominated state and local politics,” peay said. “we need to educate people about that and help them understand that if we keep utah republican, those same opportunities will still be here for our children and even our grandchildren.” cox, henderson, legislative leaders including house speaker brad wilson and senate president stuart adams, and others endorsed peay in a letter circulated to delegates, mailed using the utah republican party’s indicia — a service that’s offered to all utah gop candidates for cheaper postage. peay said those endorsements show he knows how to “build a team.” “and that’s what we plan to do,” he said, along with his vice chairperson running mate austin cox. he says he plans to do that with a unifying style. “the role of state party leadership is to build a bigger tent. it’s not to divide. it’s not to offend. rather, it’s to build a team and to get that team to coalesce around the ideas and values of the republican party.” carson jorgensen jorgensen, 31, of mount pleasant in sanpete county, is a sixth-generation sheep rancher in a family that’s lived in utah for more than 150 years, he said. his family businesses are skyline sheep co., as well as skyline bit and spur, a small business that ships horse bridles and silver. carson jorgensen carson jorgensen his family’s heritage, jorgensen said, tells the story of “why this race is important to me.” “we rely heavily on public lands,” he said, describing how the sheep industry helped build utah’s infrastructure. so that’s why he’s getting involved in politics, he said. “unfortunately, politics shapes a lot of these things,” he said. “politics is getting increasingly militant around agriculture, and if we don’t start taking a key role in policy, agriculture is going to be one that is going to lose out big time, especially here in utah where 75% of the state is federal land and most of it is used for agriculture.” jorgensen pointed to biden’s “30 by 30” climate change policy and said “it’s going to drastically affect the agriculture sector here in utah and it’s going to ruin the legacy of my family.” so, jorgensen said he wants to get involved to save the future of agriculture and public lands in utah. “i don’t want to see the history of utahns thrown under the bus for progressive policy,” he said. it’s not the first time jorgensen has stepped into politics. last year, he sent a letter to then-vice president mike pence, members of congress and others detailing the impacts to sheep ranching of the acquisition of a colorado lamb processing facility, which led to an investigation. jorgensen also ran an unsuccessful bid against rep. chris stewart last year. on his campaign website, jorgensen discusses “expanding the tent” in utah’s gop, in order to attract new voters, especially young voters. he also prioritizes strengthening rural utah, including wildfire mitigation, outdoor recreation, water quality, food supply chain and more to “bridge the urban and rural divide.” jorgensen also states utah’s gop must “tackle the issue” of sb54 and strengthen the party’s convention system. brad baker baker, 22, a weber state university student who lives in sunset, said one of the biggest reasons why he’s decided to get involved is because he’s sick of the “mudslinging, backstabbing” that’s gone on at the national level. “i firmly believe that’s not what being a republican is about,” baker said. “i would argue it’s something that both sides are guilty of, and as such the biggest thing we need as a party but as the state of utah as a whole is more unity and more hope for the future.” baker acknowledges that he does not have as much political experience as his opponents, but he argued he’s the “best equipped candidate” to make the party more appealing to younger voters and therefore secure the party’s future. “we also need to have more voices in the room from a wider variety of backgrounds, a wider variety of life experiences because how goes the republican party, so goes the state of utah,” he said. “by voting for me, the delegates would get a candidate who is emphasizing unity, emphasizing greater diversity in encouraging people to run who might not otherwise.” baker said he would expand the party’s accessibility by modernizing the party’s tactics through use of social media and technology, make sure caucus nights are better advertised so younger utahns would know how to get involved, and consider moving caucus night to the weekend to help make it more accessible to those who work during the week.

chocolate cookies with scarlet fruit by nigel slater cakes and baking. nigel’s soft and fudgy cookies are delicious paired with a  handful of summer fruit. print recipe ingredients method preheat the oven to 180c/350f/gas 4. snap the chocolate into pieces in a small heatproof glass bowl. place the bowl over a small pan of simmering water, with the base of the bowl not quite touching the water. allow the chocolate to melt. don't be tempted to stir it, other than to occasionally push any unmelted chocolate down into the liquid chocolate to encourage it to melt. turn off the heat as soon as the chocolate has melted. cream the butter and sugar together in a food processor until smooth and creamy. break the eggs and vanilla extract in a small bowl or jug, whisk just enough to break up the eggs, then add the mixture gradually to the butter and sugar, beating constantly. it is worth scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula from time to time to ensure a thorough mixing. add the melted chocolate and continue to mix. toast the hazelnuts in a shallow pan until golden, shaking regularly so they colour evenly. grind the nuts coarsely using a pestle and mortar to the texture of gravel, then remove half and continue grinding the other half until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. add the flour and both textures of nut to the cookie mixture. stop beating as soon as everything is combined. place large, heaped tablespoons of the mixture on to a baking tray lined with baking parchment. you should get twelve large biscuits. the mixture is fine to sit for a few minutes if you are cooking them in two batches. don't be tempted to flatten the cookies, they will do so in the oven anyway. bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes. the cookies will have spread and be very soft to the touch. remove them from the oven and set aside to cool a little. as soon as they are cool enough to move without breaking, slide a palette knife underneath and carefully lift them onto a cooling rack.  serve with a handful of cherries and raspberries.

gold forecast: hovering between moving averages. pay close attention to the rate of change in the yield of bonds, because if it is a slow and gradual rise, then i believe that gold should do fairly well. gold markets initially tried to rally during the course of the trading session on thursday but failed to continue going higher at the 200 day ema as it continues to be quite resistive. at this point, the market then felt to reach down below the 50 day ema, which of course was a very negative sign. however, by the end of the session we turned around to break above the 50 day ema and now it looks like the market is essentially doing the same thing it has been doing for several days. these are two major averages that a lot of people pay attention to, so it should not be overly surprising that we are stuck in this general vicinity. furthermore, you have to pay close attention to the us dollar, because the gold market is highly influenced by it. now that that we have broken down below the 50 day ema, it looks like the market is finding value hunters underneath just above the $1750 level. i think what we are looking at here is a market that is trying to figure out where we are getting ready to go longer term. when you look at the charts you can see that we have formed a double bottom just below the $1700 level, so i think if we break down below the $1750 level, then we will go testing that area. however, the $1750 level above had been resisted previously, broken out above, and now has been retested. at this point, we have to question whether or not this attempt to form a basing pattern has started to stick? a break above the $1800 level opens up the possibility of a much bigger move, and therefore i think that is the key for buying this market. until then, i would be hesitant to put a lot of money into the gold market, but it certainly looks as if we are trying to turn things around. it could be very noisy over the next couple of weeks, but i do have my eye on this market as a confirmation of the return could very well send this market looking towards the highs again. pay close attention to the rate of change in the yield of bonds, because if it is a slow and gradual rise, then i believe that gold should do fairly well.

mongrel mob members' lives taking a new direction by working with social housing provider. two mongrel mob gang members are now working with a social housing provider to change the lives of prisoners once they are released. your playlist will load after this ad   they say those released don’t have the necessary services they need for reintegration back into society.                            source: 1 news     they say those released don't have the necessary services they need to be reintegrated back into society. former armed offenders squad police officer damian white has seen karl goldsbury at his worst. behind bars for a decade, goldsbury is familiar with being on the wrong side of the law. now, two years out of prison, he's turning things around with the support of people like white. "i just wanted to be a better father, a husband, i knew my roles then because i learned what a good father looked like,” he says. the patched mongrel mob members are working for te tuinga whānau services - an organisation that's helped hundreds of vulnerable families and now plans to support gang members nearing the end of their sentence. "it'll work because just like we want māori to look after māori by māori in the housing, homeless sector,” says tommy wilson of te tuinga whānau services. the project, freedom for whānau, will target influential members of any gang, only if they're willing to change and they won't rip them away from the patch. "you can't take someone away from what they've always known all their life, it'll be like someone taking you off your parents because at the end of the day one of our bros is not going to listen to somebody else,” goldsbury says. freedom for whānau would look to start with five homes, one prisoner and their family in each house. while there they’d be provided with wrap around support services and after 12 weeks would transition into their own home. they've already been into prisons to talk about the kaupapa and in the bay of plenty the collaboration between gang members and police is seeing huge results. "all it takes now is a phone call to have some tension lessened and it is a true partnership, aspirationally these guys want the same thing as what we want for our families - they want better outcomes in education, housing and employment," white says.

gold-standard' swab tests will cost holidaymakers just £45 each. holidaymakers will be able to get a covid test for just £45 under government plans to make holidays abroad more affordable when international travel opens up. the pcr tests, which are required on entry by most european countries, would be provided for a fraction of the current price if the government's plan goes ahead, the transport secretary said. 'gold standard' pcr swab tests will continue to be required for all travellers arriving in britain, despite the prime minister previously suggesting that rapid lateral flow tests could be considered for use. the news of cheaper tests for holidaymakers comes three weeks after  boris johnson asked officials to consider using the on-the-spot rapid tests to make the tests more affordable, stating that the  reopening the holiday market from may 17 was a 'priority'.     grant shapps, the transport secretary, announced the news on thursday that 'a new entrant' had made it possible to supply pcr tests for £ currently anyone coming to the uk has to take a pre-flight test and buy a two-swab package to be used two and eight days after arrival.  official packages use gold-standard pcr technology and cost around £200 a head, this is due to fall to £45 by may 17 when some international travel is set to resume. shapps told the commons: 'i know that the house is interested on the update with regard to travel returning internationally and i wanted to provide a very quick update to say that although pcr tests may be required from a medical, scientific point of view, we have been working with private laboratories, pharmacies, supermarkets and other companies to encourage them to deliver on their logistical expertise and enter the market and drive down the cost. 'we've seen some success so far because the cost of a single pcr day two test now has come down to £60 from one of the large providers on the government-linked site, with a new entrant now at £, enabling more people to access pcr tests as international travel returns.' the drop in price brings hope to the millions of britons desperate for a foreign holiday after months of lockdown.  in other good news british tourists will be welcome in france from june 9 as long as they have proof of vaccination or a negative test. the announcement by president emmanuel macron comes as a study finds much of europe could safely be put on the travel 'green list' this summer. the list could include up to 24 countries, the times reports. mr macron's announcement will pile further pressure on ministers to restart foreign holidays to major hotspots for sun-starved britons. under france's reopening, restrictions on cafes and restaurants will be lifted gradually with a return to near-normal by june 30. the yale university research showed restarting quarantine-free travel to popular destinations such as spain, portugal and greece would not increase infection rates. and hospitalisations would only increase by about six a day if travel was restarted with up to 31 european countries. there are currently around 124 daily hospitalisations in england. johan lundgren, boss of easyjet which commissioned the study, said: 'based on the results of this ground-breaking research, and applying the principles set out in the roadmap set out by the prime minister, easyjet can demonstrate that it is safe to put much of europe on the green list. 'this is because the analysis not only shows that travel from several european countries, including popular holiday destinations like spain, portugal and greece, would not affect the uk case rate. 'but even more importantly, that travel to and from europe would have very little impact on hospitalisations in the uk.' he stressed that countries with worrying new variants should remain subject to strict measures such as quarantine. the study is due to be submitted for peer review shortly. countries' ratings as green, amber and red will be set out by may 10.

westminster redecorating could paint johnson into a corner. the writer, a former head of the downing street policy unit, is a harvard senior fellowbritish politics currently resembles a whodunnit, with westminster consumed by one question: who paid to redecorate the prime minister’s downing street flat? boris johnson will not be brought down by wallpaper-gate: voters didn’t foot the bill, and are looking forward to the summer, thanks to his swift vaccine rollout. but if the impression keeps growing that britain is run by a gilded chumocracy, it could prove toxic at the next  may seem odd that a domestic makeover has achieved such prominence. it’s partly because it is the latest in a series of allegations, including that ministers offered covid contracts to friends and helped a tory donor win a lucrative planning permission. in the early stages of the pandemic, it was understandable that urgency sometimes trumped due diligence, but there is now a feeling that too many affairs of state are being treated with casual informality. the electoral commission seems to believe that the prime minister may have broken the law. although johnson insists he has settled the £58,000 bill for the flat, he has not denied that it was originally paid for by the conservative party, through a loan or donation, neither of which were declared. the dramatic cast of characters makes it impossible to kill the story. the poisonous rasputin dominic cummings, ousted as chief of staff, is preparing a dossier of wounding information for a parliamentary committee. ben elliot, the duchess of cornwall’s nephew, was party co-chairman when a gift of £15,000 to the party from businessman lord brownlow was declared to the electoral commission; a second gift of £58,000 was not. meanwhile the first fiancée, carrie symonds, whose choice of gold wallpaper supposedly sent the prime minister into paroxysms, has been dubbed carrie  most damaging aspect may prove to be not the cover-up, but the snub to a national treasure, the john lewis department store. tatler magazine quoted unnamed friends of symonds complaining that johnson’s predecessor theresa may had created a “john lewis furniture nightmare”. the commissioning of “eco-designer” lulu lytle, whose colourful prints fill grand houses from barbados to park avenue, feels like an extravagance which is especially jarring, given symonds’ supposed environmentalism. lytle may lace her curtains with seaweed, but there’s nothing “eco” about chucking out a two-year old sofa. the taxpayer will not be footing the bill — unlike the grants given to johnson’s girlfriend jennifer arcuri when he was mayor of london, or the huge sums spent on test and trace. the problem is that it seems to cast the prime minister in a new light, as a man who cares about appearances, rather than the messy-haired rogue we thought we knew. central to boris johnson’s charm is that he has always looked a shambles, lived off pizza, ridden rickety bikes, enjoyed a good boogie on the dance floor, and not given a damn. he has always worried about money, but mainly to support his children from official and unofficial dalliances. his mistakes and lack of pretension have made him human, in an age of robotic  diss john lewis, however, is to attack an institution which has served middle england from cradle to grave. many of us got our school uniforms there, we had our wedding lists there, and we still buy presents for granny there, knowing she can always return them with no fuss. its genius is to be faintly upmarket but not flashy: as voters might once have seen boris. british prime ministers are unusual in having to live above the shop in pretty modest circumstances. most opt for the four-bedroom flat above number 11 downing street, and let their chancellor use the smaller one above number 10. when you work in the building, you get used to bumping into the country’s leaders on the back stairs, and seeing their children playing in the garden. the elysée palace or the white house it ain’t — i used to take my turn with the policemen for the only shower-room — but it supports our belief that we are a sober nation of principle. at chequers, the prime minister’s country house, i was once told approvingly by staff that gordon brown was so parsimonious that he had refused to light the log fires. there is actually a strong argument for the state to do more to maintain these official buildings. but it was cack-handed to have tried to create a downing street trust to fund improvements which might in turn have saved johnson from having to cough up. next week’s local elections will show whether the public has noticed any of this. i suspect they won’t. johnson has a strong poll lead and a large majority. the risk is that the drip-drip of sleaze allegations will slowly corrode this government just as it doomed john major’s in the 1990s, when a minister was jailed for perjury, and some mps took “cash for questions”. it felt then as though the tories had been in power too long. could “cash for curtains” create a similar ennui?john lewis’s legendary slogan is “never knowingly undersold”. i would add: never knowingly underestimate boris johnson. but if he doesn’t come clean, and if this wasn’t the only loan, this may prove to have been the moment he painted himself into a corner.

covid-19 vaccination take-up rate among seniors good but more can be done, say experts. singapore: the take-up rate of covid-19 vaccination among seniors is acceptable, or even good, but more can be done to boost numbers, infectious diseases experts said. senior minister of state for health janil puthucheary said earlier this month that about 60 per cent of eligible seniors aged 70 and above have received the covid-19 vaccination or booked their vaccination appointments, while the corresponding proportion for eligible seniors aged 60 to 69 is close to 70 per cent. infectious diseases experts said that the proportion is good, especially in comparison to the take-up rate of the influenza vaccination, which they said is the most comparable to the covid-19 vaccination. “i think it’s an acceptable figure. if you look at the influenza vaccination, which has been promoted annually, we don’t even achieve 15 to 20 per cent, so this is actually very good,” said infectious diseases specialist at mount elizabeth novena hospital dr leong hoe nam. when asked if the better take-up for the covid-19 vaccination is because it is potentially fatal, he said that the flu can also be fatal, taking the lives of 200 out of every 100,000 people aged 70 and above annually in singapore. influenza can trigger heart attack and stroke, he explained.      read: covid-19 vaccination for seniors aged 70 and above begins in singapore professor paul tambyah, president of the asia pacific society of clinical microbiology and infection, said that the take-up rate among seniors is “really good”. “flu is also known to be fatal in elderly people. in fact, it's probably comparable fatality rate (with covid-19), especially among the very old,” he said. however, experts said there is a need for more seniors to be vaccinated. "we want vaccine uptake to be as high as possible," said dr hannah clapham, assistant professor at the saw swee hock school of public health. there are two reasons for wanting a high level of vaccination - so that people are protected from covid-19 and to boost population immunity.  “for the senior group, the first reason is very important as if people in this group become infected, they have a high risk of severe disease,” she said. read: covid-19 vaccination for people aged 60 to 69 brought forward, invitations to go out in 'next few days': moh people should get vaccinated so that “as a whole, as a country, we can boost our population-based immunity and as a result of that, we may be able to inch towards normalcy”, said dr ling li min, an infectious diseases physician at rophi clinic. what is being done to encourage seniors such health and community benefits are among the explanations silver generation office (sgo) volunteer vesuvasam perianar gives to seniors when he goes door to door to engage them. sgo, the outreach arm of the agency for integrated care, has been engaging seniors since february this year with the help of about 3,000 volunteers. “our main job is to ask them if they have received the letters. if they have and have not made the appointment we will ask them why they have not made the appointment,” the 66-year-old told cna. if seniors indicate that they need help in booking a slot, mr perianar will help them on the spot. “in most cases, they will say ‘my children will help, but they haven’t had time, they will do it in a short while, maybe a few days later’,” he said. others may be waiting for their next medical appointment in a month or two with their regular doctors to make sure that the vaccination is safe for them, he added. information on their plans to register for a slot goes into a report he has to create at the end of these sessions, mr perianar said. based on the report, a volunteer - not necessarily him - will then go back to the home to get an update on the status of the booking. mr perianar does these engagements with a partner four times a week for about two hours each time. read: government plans to invite people below the age of 45 to book covid-19 vaccination slots from june sgo also arranges transport for seniors who are not able to get to a vaccination centre on their own, he said. mr perianar said that while the majority of the seniors he approaches would say that they would be booking an appointment, or need help doing so, about 20 per cent of them would be sceptical or distrustful of the vaccination regime. to convince seniors, he tells them that they may not be able to travel overseas, even for religious pilgrimage, without the vaccination. he also uses himself as an example of someone who has had the vaccination.  he said: “sometimes after we speak for a while … they will be more open. they will say ‘ok lah, i’ll consider lah’.” still, some of them are “very adverse”, calling the regime a “government gimmick” and refusing to accept a leaflet containing more information, he said. he said that some of them bring up negative news about vaccination and have fears of overdosing, or deaths that they misunderstand that have happened because of the vaccination. barriers to vaccination dr leong said individuals have different reasons for not wanting to get the vaccination. “there are many elderly people whom i have spoken to who say: ‘i’m not afraid of covid-19. in fact if i die, so be it. i’m not afraid of dying’,” he said. barriers to seniors getting vaccinated could include mobility, logistics and understanding of the vaccination, said dr ling.  “they (seniors) may at times listen to their friends more than what is on the mainstream media. sometimes, older folks, they could have more inertia to get themselves vaccinated,” she said. some of them may not feel the need to get the vaccination especially if community numbers are low and they don’t go out so much, she added. dr clarence tam, assistant professor at the saw swee hock school of public health, said that findings from a survey he recently conducted with his team suggest that many people are taking a wait-and-see approach. “they are unsure if the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks of side effects, particularly given that the risk of contracting covid-19 is currently low,” said dr tam. the survey, which has not been published, was conducted online earlier this month among 1,000 singapore residents aged 21 and above. findings were similar among seniors and other groups, he added. what can be done to improve take-up among seniors when asked what would make them more willing to get vaccinated, respondents commonly mentioned personal recommendations from healthcare professionals, family, employers, friends and the government, said dr tam. for a third of respondents, a strong motivator would be the relaxation of social distancing rules if many people are vaccinated, he added. seeing positive stories on social media from people who had been vaccinated would also make them willing, dr tam said. in contrast, people would be put off vaccination if a family member had a bad reaction to the vaccine, if friends or family advised against vaccination or if they saw content on social media advising against vaccination, he said. “positive reinforcement and prompts from a broad range of trusted sources will be needed to encourage undecided individuals to get vaccinated,” he said, adding that healthcare professionals have an important role to play, particularly in allaying worries about side effects. dr leong, who said that singapore should increase the proportion of vaccinated seniors by 10 per cent, said that videos of elderly public figures getting vaccinated could help. the narrative used to convince the elderly should revolve around helping their families, he said. “it could be someone saying ‘i am a grandmother, i am 70 years old, i am getting myself vaccinated because of my grandchildren’,” he said. another way is to regularly organise trips to vaccination centres for seniors, ferrying five seniors at a go. “what we have to do is literally take the mountain to muhammad,” he said. however, dr leong said that he expects many seniors who have not been vaccinated to be immobile and that they may not account for much in overall herd immunity. “individuals who are mobile, interacting in public areas are more important in the calculation of herd immunity. these individuals tend to be more well-informed, a bit on the younger side of 70 and they would be interacting with their peers,” he said. bookmark this: our comprehensive coverage of the coronavirus outbreak and its developments download  our app  or subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:
"i am not 100% sure i am correct but here is what i think is quite probable to happen in the near future.
starting from the middle of summer, the levels of the vaccine-induced antibodies will become very low for all those people who got their second mrna vaccine shot in december, january, and february. we will probably hear more and more reports about already vaccinated people getting covid-19 and these will probably be not only the mild cases.
the reason for that is that mrna vaccines rely mostly on neutralizing antibodies to achieve protection against the virus. because the levels of antibodies, in absence of an active infection, go down very quickly, the result is that these vaccines give relatively good protection but only for a short period of time.
the situation looks completely different in the case of ino-4800. inovio's vaccine generates a balanced immune response which provides both high levels (not a very high level) of antibodies as well a high level of t-cells. it is a well-known fact that it is the t-cells that actually provide long-lasting protection.
if i am right, we should see a new push (from the most famous american doctor who may not not even have a valid doctor's license anymore) to give the ""booster"" shots to the arms of all those people that already got their two previous shots.
all in all, there is a chanve it is going to be a total mess. the third mrna shot will probably have even more side effects and it will probably only extend the protection for another ~6 months.
if all of this looks like a disaster for the patients it is actually a god-send golden goose for the bp.
remember, bp wants to have you as a customer for as long as they only can, so short-lasting vaccine protection combined with the raging pandemic is all they could dream of.
i only wish someone at the top of the government is bright enough to understand a rich nation like the usa should not rely on just one unproven vaccine technology and instead should have multiple layers of backup plans which should include dna vaccines and *all* other viable options too."

first observation | these words of the general secretary are not just to say one time and one place. in the past few days, general secretary xi jinping visited guangxi and gave important instructions on the construction of ecological civilization along the way. many golden sentences have been brushed off the screen. at almost the same time, the central ecological environmental protection inspectorate in eight provinces and autonomous regions notified many typical cases of destroying the ecological environment. it is thought-provoking to link these two things together. on the lijiang river, general secretary xi jinping listened to a report on the comprehensive management of the river basin. in recent years, guilin city has vigorously promoted the lijiang river to &quot;control chaos, water, mountains, and root causes&quot; to improve the ecological environment of the lijiang river. xinhua news agency reporter shen hongshe general secretary emphasized, “the worst thing is quarrying. if you destroy a mountain, you will lose such a mountain forever. the whole of china and the world is such a treasure. don’t destroy it.” central ecological environment among the typical cases just exposed by the protection inspection team, there are several cases of illegal quarrying and mining. in some places, illegal quarrying is still carried out in the world geopark reserve, which has caused serious ecological damage. this time, the general secretary pointed out the quarrying problem straightforwardly, which is very realistic for some places. since the 18th national congress of the communist party of china, whether it is for domestic investigations and investigations or attending international events, wherever general secretary xi jinping goes, he has talked about the concept that green waters and green mountains are golden mountains and silver mountains. however, some phenomena that seriously damage the ecology and seriously pollute the environment are still exposed from time to time. what is the problem behind this? some local leading cadres believe that the region has a good ecological background, large environmental capacity, a little sewage, a little tree cut, and a little project &quot;innocent&quot;, and they lack understanding of the urgency of ecological environmental protection. the concept of &quot;emphasizing development and neglecting protection&quot; of some local leading cadres has not been fundamentally reversed, and the phenomenon that ecological environmental protection is &quot;important when it comes to it, but secondary when it is done&quot; still occurs from time to time. there are also historical reasons that some local leading cadres &quot;should the pot&quot;, and the ability and level of governance to implement the new development concept still needs to be improved. &quot;any abuse of mining and digging requires not only accountability, but also criminal responsibility in accordance with the law.&quot; regarding the chaos of quarrying, the general secretary&#39;s words were very serious, and once again sounded the alarm for the ecological and environmental protection of various places. in fact, this is also the consistent attitude of the party central committee towards ecological and environmental issues. the illegal construction of villas in qinling mountains destroys the ecological environment. general secretary xi jinping has issued important instructions 6 times to solve the problems personally; local ecological damage in the qilian mountains, pollution incident in the tengger desert, illegal filling of the qiandao lake... grasp the problem of destruction to the end. there is a phenomenon that is particularly noteworthy. in the past few days, the central ecological and environmental protection inspection team has exposed many typical cases of blindly expanding production capacity and launching projects regardless of resource endowments-shanxi jinzhong city has not approved the first construction and launched five large-scale coking projects in violation of regulations. enterprises illegally discharged pollutants and competed with the people for water, causing difficulties for nearby residents. the construction of chemical and coal power projects in guzhen county, anhui illegally started construction, and the bottom line of regional environmental quality has been repeatedly breached, posing a threat to the water ecological environment of the huaihe river... in the first year of the fourth five-year plan, after experiencing the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic and facing the external environment of headwinds and currents, the enthusiasm for development projects in some places began to swell, and they wanted to pursue a &quot;good start.&quot; the central ecological and environmental protection supervisor is approved by the party central committee. at the beginning of the &quot;14th five-year plan&quot;, this inspection was organized, and the strict control of high energy-consuming and high-emission projects was blindly launched as one of the inspection priorities, which was very targeted. coincidentally, 5 years ago, the &quot;13th five-year plan&quot; started. before that, in 2015, china&#39;s economic growth continued to slow down, falling below 7%. some provinces and cities along the yangtze river are gearing up for projects in the 13th five-year plan. on january 5, 2016, general secretary xi jinping convened a symposium on promoting the development of the yangtze river economic belt in chongqing, and he eloquently proposed “to protect together, and not to develop”. &quot;it seems to be a pot of cold water.&quot; this symposium promptly cooled the development impulse of the provinces and cities along the yangtze river, and it was a reversal of the direction of economic development. in the past five years, the general secretary hosted three symposiums around the development of the yangtze river economic belt to consolidate the path of ecological priority and green development. practice has proved that the joint efforts to protect the provinces and cities along the yangtze river not only did not affect the development speed of the provinces and cities along the yangtze river, but also greatly enhanced the supporting and leading role of the yangtze river economic belt in supporting the high-quality development of the country. looking at the first year in five years, getting started is critical. the &quot;14th five-year plan&quot; is a critical period and window period for carbon peaks. once the “two highs” project blindly launched, it will not only damage the current ecological environment, but also pose a severe challenge to the future carbon dioxide emission reduction and the achievement of carbon peak and carbon neutral commitments. it is very necessary to press down on such signs from the beginning. combining this background, and looking at the words of the general secretary during this guangxi inspection, we can bring out more profound meaning-&quot;adhere to the correct ecological concept and development concept&quot;; &quot;maintain the authenticity and integrity of the landscape ecology as an important &quot;work&quot;; &quot;incorporate carbon peaking and carbon neutrality into the overall layout of economic and social development and ecological civilization construction&quot;; &quot;promote a comprehensive green transformation of economic and social development&quot;; &quot;come on a path of high-quality development that conforms to local realities&quot;... this it was spoken to guangxi, and it was spoken to the whole country. a good start, a good start. the alarm bells must be ringing forever in all places, and the trend of destroying the ecological environment in exchange for economic development at a time, insisting on ecological priority and promoting high-quality development can create a high-quality and happy life for the people. producer: zhao cheng planning: huo xiaoguang coordinating: zhang xiaosong, qi zhongxi, wang yu,

as america reckons with racism, kamala harris puts her identity as the first black vp front and center. something went wrong. please try again later. something went wrong. please try again later. shagara bradshaw wasn’t expecting anything out of the ordinary last month when she dropped into a vaccination site in jacksonville, florida, for her second covid-19 shot. bradshaw hadn’t heard that vice president kamala harris was visiting the tented facility to encourage people to get vaccinated. but when she was pulled out of the registration line to meet harris, bradshaw knew how she wanted to introduce herself. “good afternoon, soror,” bradshaw, 38, said to her delighted fellow alpha kappa alpha sorority sister and fellow graduate of a historically black university. as navy troops wearing military fatigues prepared doses, bradshaw and harris chatted about being a role model by getting vaccinated and about bradshaw’s job at a jacksonville school where she is teacher of the year – an honor that was the  until she met harris. “i felt like i was speaking to someone that understood me,” bradshaw said. “she knows what it’s like, the struggles of african american women, what we have to go through.” identity front and center harris, the first woman – and first woman of color – to hold the second-highest national office, has embraced that identity at a time when the country is facing a racial reckoning – and when race remains a deeply sensitive and politically volatile issue. as democrats applaud the spotlight that harris and others in the administration have put on equity, republicans accuse the administration of deepening the racial divide by ignoring gains in the fight against racism. “hear me clearly: america is not a racist country,” south carolina sen. tim scott, the only african american republican in the senate, said in the gop’s response to president joe biden’s joint address to congress wednesday. harris, the next morning, responded that she does not believe america is a racist country. “but we also do have to speak truth about racism in this country, and its existence today,” harris said on abc’s “good morning america.” harris' willingness to dive right into the topic is evident in a usa today review of her public schedule, which shows how much she has emphasized issues important to people of color, and to women, in her first 100 days. other than administering the oath of office to fellow cabinet members or interacting with foreign leaders, most of the more than 40 other solo activities on her public schedule through late april have had at least some connection to her identity and those who share it. harris traveled to the majority minority cities of oakland, california, to discuss “water equity”; new haven, connecticut, to talk about child poverty and education, and greensboro, north carolina, to talk about jobs – and to sit at the former woolworth’s lunch counter where a peaceful sit-in became a defining moment in the civil rights movement. while emphasizing the need to "speak truth" even if it “may make folks uncomfortable,” harris has met with black mayors, members of local black chambers of commerce, leaders of the congressional black caucus, women’s leadership groups, female labor leaders and faith leaders from minority communities. “the truth is,” she told the house democratic caucus in march, “inequity has become the norm.” 'you are strong': vice president kamala harris has a message for american women in the washington, , area, harris visited a women-owned knitting store (where one of the yarn colors was named after her), a vaccination site in an african american neighborhood and a veterans affairs hospital where she delivered valentine’s day treats to about two dozen workers of color. she lauded the work of black women in science during a visit to the national institutes of health where she met dr. kizzy corbett, who worked on the moderna vaccine. “for people to know that a black woman helped develop the moderna vaccine, and for the vice president, who is a black woman, to highlight the work of black women in science, that's critical," said duchess harris, professor of political science and american studies at macalester college in saint paul. on international women’s day , harris was on hand when biden praised the promotion of two female generals to four-star commands. she recounted roles women have played in defending the nation, including transporting sensitive military information through enemy territory during the american revolution and disguising themselves as men to fight in the civil war. even a virtual visit with the prime minister of ireland on st. patrick’s day emphasized the familiar theme. the two leaders celebrated the first group of ireland-bound frederick douglass global fellows, participants of a summer study abroad program for students of color. “together, may we build on the legacies of frederick douglass … and all of those who have fought for freedom,” harris said after showing off the sculpture of the abolitionist displayed in her office that’s on loan from her alma mater, howard university, a historically black university. 'my vp looks like me’ many americans who haven’t felt fully represented in washington have been thrilled to see themselves and their experiences reflected through harris, akin to how a young black boy wanted to touch president barack obama’s hair to find out if it felt like his. “my vp looks like me!!” read the chalkboard held up by 6-year-old maya cedor when harris went to connecticut. during harris’ jacksonville visit , a 9-year-old black girl waved a sign painted in pink and purple letters that read “girls can change the world.” obama, however, found he paid a price in 2009 when answered a question about the arrest in cambridge, massachusetts, of henry louis gates jr., a black harvard professor. the arrest occurred at gates' own home after police responded to the report of a possible break-in as gates was trying to force his door open. after obama criticized cambridge police for acting "stupidly," he saw a huge drop in support from white voters. "it was support that i'd never completely get back," he wrote in his memoir. niambi carter, associate professor of political science at howard university in washington, said obama didn't have "the space or the room" to address his identity the way that harris does just a decade later. ange-marie hancock alfaro, a political science professor at the university of southern california who is helping to organize a scholarly convention on harris, dismissed the risk that harris could become too narrowly defined. “i don't think that she would be pigeon holed so much as i think that there's a calculation being made that a certain part of the population will never agree that structural racism exists,’’ she said. 'mandate from the base’ aimee allison, head of the advocacy group she the people, which pushed biden to choose a woman of color as his running mate, said harris and biden have a “mandate from the base” to directly address racial, economic and gender issues. “it’s demonstrated she is proof positive that who she is, and her experience, makes her more qualified, not less, makes her more able to speak to america and lead america, not less,” allison said. after a record number of women ran for – and failed to win – the 2020 presidential nomination, biden committed to picking a woman as his running mate. he faced tremendous pressure to choose a woman of color because of the large role african americans – and particularly black women – have played in the democratic party and because of the racial issues thrust into the foreground through the coronavirus pandemic and the deaths of black americans at the hands of police. partnering with biden biden seems to make a point of having her by his side at public events like bill signings as well as private meetings, including his daily security briefings and updates on the pandemic. the significant amount of time she’s spent with biden so far is important not only for developing their relationship, said vice presidential scholar joel goldstein. it also “credentializes” her. “the fact that she’s in the room makes her important to everybody else,” he said. harris has had more than 120 joint public or private events with biden, compared with more than 80 solo activities, according to a usa today review of the daily schedules released by the white house and announcements of calls with foreign leaders through april 28. (the publicly released schedules include only a fraction of the president’s and vice president’s activities.) “she’s not been a vp that you don’t see or hear from,’’ said melanie campbell, convener of the black women's roundtable. harris addressed the group at its virtual conference last month. "whether we’re in the room or not, we know she’s in the room,” campbell said. biden speaks out too while most of harris’ solo events – outside of swearing-in cabinet officials or talking with foreign leaders – have had a connection to her identity, biden hasn’t relegated the equity issue to harris. he’s vowed to “make equity and justice part of what we do every day.” and when biden speaks on the issue, as he did when former minneapolis police officer derek chauvin was convicted of murdering george floyd, his words naturally carry more import. but, as president, biden’s task is also to try to appeal to everyone, regardless of color, race and ethnic origin, said nina rees, who was a domestic policy aide to former vice president dick cheney. and it’s smart to put harris forward when the issues of diversity, inclusion and equity have played such a large role in the public conversation. “the right messages matters,” rees said, “but having the right messenger matters just as much.” 'picking up that mantle' outlining harris’ early activities, a senior white house official said harris raised in every meeting about the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package the particular problems faced by women workers who have lost jobs at higher rates and had to leave the workforce to care for children. debbie walsh, director of the center for american women and politics at rutgers university, said harris is “really picking up that mantle” on gender wage gaps, healthcare disparities and childcare concerns “in a way that i just don't think would happen in the same way, or have the same resonance or the same impact, if there weren't a woman and a woman of color in that position.” the day after chauvin was convicted of murdering floyd, harris and new jersey sen. cory booker ducked into the vice president’s office just off the senate floor to strategize advancing the police reform bill they’d introduced after floyd’s death last year when harris was in the senate. “we had a good talk about not just the urgency of the bill, but she had some really practical thoughts,’’ booker said, noting harris’ experience as california’s attorney general. 'do they see themselves?' another early priority was the paycheck protection program , federal loans to help businesses survive the pandemic that the new administration believed were not getting to those most in need, including the smallest businesses and those in rural or minority communities. harris got on the phone with bank ceos, according to an administration official, but wanted to make business owners themselves aware that things had changed. that’s why harris met with members of the black chamber of commerce and with people like wendy garcia, an arizona woman who came to the united states from mexico when she was 17 and now has her own restaurant. in fact, all of the small business owners she met with on one of her first days in office were either women, people of color, or both. harris tells her aides to think about the fact that when someone looks at a wedding album of a friend, they’re most interested in the photos in which they appear. “and that’s how we’re thinking about the american people,” said rohini kosoglu, harris’ chief domestic policy adviser. “when they see these plans, do they see themselves in the plan?” tackling migration harris’ most high profile – and potentially trickiest – assignment is working with mexico and the northern triangle countries to try to stem the flow of migrants to the  border. the administration has struggled to handle the record number of unaccompanied children crossing the border as biden tries to deliver on a promise of creating a more humane and equitable system for immigrants and refugees. republicans have hammered harris for not going to the southern border, bringing to a recent news conference a milk carton with her picture on the side along with the words “missing at the border.” louisiana rep. steve scalise, the no. 2 house republican, said harris "needs to go down to the border and see this for herself." when harris traveled to new hampshire last week, a protestor held up a sign with an arrow and the directions: "mexico – 2,254 mi." harris and her team have emphasized that she is working on the root causes, and not the symptoms, of the problem. “it is something that is going to require diplomatic work,” harris said this month, a few days after announcing she will travel to mexico and guatemala. she met virtually monday with guatemalan president alejandro giammattei and plans to talk soon with mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador. high rewards and high risks the university of southern california’s hancock alfaro said the assignment could have high rewards and risks. it raises harris’ foreign policy profile and biden will be grateful if she comes up with solutions. but it also puts her “right square in the middle of one of our country’s most controversial subjects.” california rep. barbara lee, who is working on the issue with harris through a house subcommittee lee chairs that funds international activities, said harris brings to the task the perspective of being the daughter of immigrants from india and jamaica. “it’s not going to be easy, but she’s going to do it,” lee said. “have you ever had a black woman and south asian woman deal with it?” michael feldman, who was a senior adviser to former vice president al gore, said harris should welcome such a meaty task with both international and domestic consequences. “guess what?” he said. “you’re not an effective vice president if you’re not willing to take on the tough problems.” fact check: claims that vp kamala harris refused to salute the military are missing context future presidential bid? speculation on her own presidential ambitions is a topic harris avoids for now. but if she were to run, rallying the base – which is dominated by women and people of color – would be essential. booker, a close friend of harris, said she is “ 100% focused on the now.” “she knows we are in a national crisis.” 2024: biden plans to run for re-election, 'would fully expect' kamala harris to be running mate one person who hopes to see harris in the top job one day is gayathri cedor, the mother of 6-year-old maya who held up the “my vp looks like me!!” sign in new haven, connecticut. when cedor heard harris was coming, she wanted her daughter and son to get a glimpse, even if it was only of the vice president’s motorcade leaving the airport. like harris, cedor’s children’s are half indian and half black, a fact she noted on the other side of the chalkboard. their families even share some of the same first names, like maya and mina. “we were waving to her and she gave a thumbs up,” said cedor, a 42-year-old mechanical engineer. “it’s just so exciting to see that background represented at such a high level.” outside of the vice president's trip to her city, cedor hasn’t been closely following harris’ activities or the new administration generally but is pleased with the overall vibe. “it just feels like it reflects america,” she said. “it reflects us.”

ben fogle recalls being left red faced by wife's toilet dash at prince william's wedding. ben fogle, 47, recalled the time he was left slightly embarrassed after his wife marina, had to dash to the toilet at prince william and kate's wedding in 2011 and was caught in the isle just as the queen arrived. ben's wife and her family have been close friends with the duke and duchess of cambridge for years, and he spoke about how honoured he was to have had an invite to the wedding of the decade. full of excitement to be there during the historic moment, there was one thing that was at the forefront of the couple's minds. recalling the run up to the big day and the wedding itself in his latest column for the telegraph, ben revealed marina was pregnant with their second child iona at the time. "she would be eight months along at the wedding," he penned. "what if she went into labour? i had a few sleepless nights worrying about that." there was another pressing matter at hand, too. having been in antartica on an expedition when they received the invite, the presenter was in dire need of a new suit to accommodate the 15kg he had lost during the baltic challenge. "there was a 'royal wedding waiting list' at savile row tailor huntsman," he remembered. "i wasn't the only guest after something new for the big day." managing to find a suit suitable for the royal family and the millions who would be watching around the world, ben's worries cast back to the pregnancy and if something was to happen during the ceremony. "we had been asked to arrive at westminster abbey early - two hours, i recall," he continued. "so early that marina needed a pregnancy induced wee just before the bride and groom arrived. "my sisters in law seized the opportunity to join her in a not insignificant dash across the abbey, getting caught in the aisle just as the queen arrived." he added: "i remember my face reddening at that." luckily iona arrived a few weeks later, with ben joking: "[she] had the good grace not to appear at the wedding itself." but he remembered it all become a bit too much for heavily pregnant marina, and she collapsed into a chair as elton john played the piano. thankfully it was nothing serious, and ben even confessed it was rather "amusing". he continued: "it was at this point that marina had a wobble and collapsed, feeling faint, onto a golden chair in a room full of royals. "it was surreal - and quite amusing. "i held her hand as we walked downstairs to the garden for the most memorable part of the reception."

cliff walkers. starring: yu hewei, zhang yi, qin hailu, zhu yawen, liu haocun, ni dahong, li naiwen, yu ailei , zhou xiaofan   director: zhang yimou another classy chinese action thriller whose dazzling style seems to take place in a deliberate narrative void, “ ” (previously titled “impasse”) marks leading chinese director zhang yimou’s first foray into the espionage genre. following on the heels of his “one second,” the new film is dedicated to “the heroes of the revolution.” what  audiences will take away is a visually entrancing parade of attractive actors in a pleasingly fluid spy-counterspy dance. the film is set in the 1930s following the japanese occupation of manchukuo, a northeast puppet state that was once chinese manchuria. the atrocities committed by parts of the japanese army during this period were recently dramatized in kiyoshi kurosawa’s “wife of a spy,” best director award winner at venice 2020. here, again, the action is premised on the urgent need to get information out for the world to judge and act upon. in this case, the sole survivor of a manchurian death camp must be smuggled out of china as an eyewitness to japanese war crimes. the chinese communist party sends in a team of four secret agents, who have been highly trained in the soviet union and who are determined to succeed. we meet them parachuting through the snow over a forest of fir trees and falling gracefully through their branches to the ground in a mesmerizing opener. this lyrical intro sets the scene for some soulful cinematography and atmospheric sequences that will drive the film in place of a convincing spy story. the four are two couples: the married pair zhang (zhang yi of “operation red sea”) and yu (qin hailu), and the younger chuliang (zhu yawen) and his waif-like girlfriend lan (liu haocun). zhang, the team leader, remixes the couples and they take off in different directions, heading for the northern capital of harbin, where they are to rendezvous with the eyewitness. but first, there are obstacles to overcome, codes to decipher and a bewildering series of turncoats, traitors and counterspies to unmask. the agents board a train to harbin incognito and wait for a signal from an accomplice, but are double-crossed by a possible traitor. fisticuffs follow. after that, the narrative becomes intricate enough to be safely ignored, especially since zhang and quan yongxian’s screenplay doesn’t take the story nearly as seriously as the staging of sophisticated set pieces. many scenes enjoyably salute cinema past, from charlie chaplin’s potato dance in an excerpt from “the gold rush,” to a whistling tune heard in front of a firing squad that tips its hat to sergio leone. yu hewei appears late in the tale as embedded secret agent zhou, who has to liaise with the team while sidestepping the ambiguous sector chief and head torturer, gao (ni dahong). though at first she seems like an add-on ingénue to the mission, young liu haocun (who also appears in “one second”) eventually comes across as the most individualized member of the team, capable not only of deciphering deep codes but of feeling pain for the tortured fates of others. qin hailu, who starred in fruit chan’s “durian durian,” has a memorable maternal moment. apart from the sassy costumes, production design by lin mu re-creates harbin's old streets and buildings with an aura of nostalgia. the movie is now being screened in shenzhen.   （sd-agencies)
full fda approval of covid-19 vaccines could help fight vaccine hesitancy, officials say. (cnn)as a condition of the emergency use authorizations issued for the pfizer/biontech and moderna coronavirus vaccines, those companies are expected to work toward asking the us food and drug administration for full approval -- and some health officials are hoping it will happen soon. dr. sanjay gupta looks into the origins of vaccine hesitancy dr. fauci explains importance of vaccine approval process what medical professionals are doing to fight vaccine hesitancy these vaccines have been in use since mid-december under emergency use authorizations, known as euas. during the pandemic, real-world data have shown the vaccines are against the coronavirus that causes covid-19. dr. anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, told cnn's jim sciutto on wednesday he hopes covid-19 vaccines will receive full fda approval "very soon," and that the fda will work "as expeditiously as possible" on approval applications for coronavirus vaccines as they come in. progressing from authorized to approved would allow manufacturers to market and directly distribute their vaccines. it could also have an impact on vaccine mandates -- and perhaps sway skeptics hesitant to get the vaccines now. the road to fda approval currently, the three covid-19 vaccines distributed in the united states -- made by pfizer/biontech, moderna and johnson & johnson -- are authorized, but not approved. due to the seriousness of the pandemic, vaccine makers originally applied for euas because the authorization process takes less time than what would be required for full approval. emergency use authorization is what its name suggests -- a medical product, such as a vaccine, that gets special fda authorization to be used during an emergency. when the health emergency is over, "then any eua(s) issued based on that declaration will no longer remain in effect," according to the fda. so, vaccine makers will have to file a separate application for vaccines to be fully licensed. cnn has contacted pfizer/biontech, moderna and johnson & johnson -- the most recent covid-19 vaccine to be authorized -- about their plans to apply for full approval of their vaccines. none provided a timeline. the typical approval process for vaccine developers requires completing lab research, pre-clinical testing and phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials in humans. that has already been done for these coronavirus vaccines. the fda also requires vaccine manufacturers to submit data to support their manufacturing processes, facilities, product characterization and demonstration that the vaccine can be produced reliably and consistently. once all of that is complete -- both the clinical trials and manufacturing details -- companies can submit a biologics license application or bla to the fda. "by submitting a bla to the fda, a company is seeking permission to distribute and market a vaccine for use in the united states," according to the fda's website. "fda evaluates the data to determine whether the safety and ness of the vaccine has been demonstrated and whether the manufacturing and facility information assure product quality and consistency. after its evaluation, fda decides whether to approve (also known as to license) the vaccine for use in the united states." applications designated as "priority review" mean the fda's goal is to take action on an application within six months. a "standard review" could take longer. "when you're getting a formal approval you have to have a certain amount of time just observing predominantly the safety -- and obviously the safety looks really, really good in well over 140 million people having been vaccinated with at least a single dose," fauci said on cnn on wednesday. after all, as spread of the virus is reduced, the nation may no longer be under an emergency situation and the vaccines will need a different type of green light under the fda. the agency is "the gold standard of a safety and regulatory organization throughout the world," said fauci, chief medical adviser to president biden. "i hope they do it quickly." 'it will help show skeptics that the authorized covid vaccines are safe' a concern around authorized-but-unapproved vaccines hinges on vaccine hesitancy. if history is any indication, skepticism -- if not outright mistrust -- about an unapproved vaccine is nothing new. one study published in 2009, months after the us declared a public health emergency due to the h1n1 influenza and the world health organization declared it a pandemic, researchers explored the public's willingness to use a drug or a vaccine with an eua -- not full fda approval -- by surveying a representative sample of more than 1,500 us adults. the researchers, from the university of pittsburgh and the university of georgia, found that about 77% of respondents would be moderately, very or extremely worried if offered an unapproved vaccine; some 63% said they would not take it. but the study also found that there were some other key factors that would convince respondents that a vaccine authorized under an eua was safe to use. if the vaccine were administered by a public health professional, 55% of respondents said they would take it. if it came with a fact sheet, just over 57% of those surveyed said they would get it. if their own health care provider administered the vaccine, that number shot up to 68%. dr. jerome adams, us surgeon general during the trump administration, wrote in an opinion piece published in the washington post on tuesday that approval will help show skeptics that the authorized coronavirus vaccines are safe. "we should also pursue full food and drug administration approval and expand covid vaccinations to youths," adams wrote in part. "the individuals who got vaccinated early on were generally high risk and willing to take a vaccine authorized for emergency use. but many people who are lower risk understandably ask if the benefits justify taking a medication that has not received the full and traditional fda stamp of approval," he wrote. "as vaccine manufacturers complete further studies, which will eventually lead to expanded eligibility among minors, it will help show skeptics that the authorized covid vaccines are safe." plans to require vaccines some organizations say they expect to require the vaccine, but have opted not to while it's authorized and not yet fully approved. "people, when they hear it's still emergency use, they still have a little concern about how far you can go with it," fauci said on cnn wednesday. the university of california and california state university systems announced last week that their universities intend to require faculty, staff and students to be vaccinated against the coronavirus -- but the requirement would go into effect only once a vaccine has received full fda approval. the proposed policy would begin this fall. the california state university noted in its announcement, "this requirement will become at the beginning of the fall 2021 term, or upon full fda approval of the vaccine, whichever occurs later."

"the ultimate dd to the moon. crazy melon.. **hey everyone. the melon crazy guys again.**
if you don’t have a tin foil hat and don’t have patience for this post, don’t worry about it, just buy and hold!!!
this is really deep after more than 4 months of research!
none of this is financial advice.
***warning:*** *i’m not gonna go and post links about this information and i’m not going to confirm anything in here. everything is basing your trust in this random redditor individual and your own logic. if any of this make sense keep going and fact check it yourself. excuse my english too, it's my second language.*
**take everything with a huge grain of salt!!**
let’s start!!
the current us dollar backing is based on fiat now, check it out:
.asp
**they can print “almost unlimited amount of dollars”** and they been doing so! 1/5 of the total dollars have been printed in the last year and a half btw!
but let’s continue.
**what does this have to do with gme?**
by changing from gold to oil then to fiat, they have an almost unlimited amount of currency backing  they are allowed to print an almost “unlimited” amount of dollars. you starting to get my point? well let’s keep digging baby!
*\*\*keep the tin foil hats on, take everything i say with a huge grain of salt and you do your own fact check or simple don’t trust this crazy person :)\*\**
**part 2: citadel/kenny g's infinite money glitch with bonds**
#**an overview of kenny/shytadel strategy:**#
* **gme retail/brokerages send money to citadel mm (market maker)**
* **shitadel take the money, buys the gme share though an etf^ (so doesn’t reflect on the price) then sell it trough the main exchanges (so price fully affects as a sell and tank the prices on the exchange)**
^ mainly uses mortgage and auto loan dark pool etf
* ** then doesn’t deliver the share to the broker/retail (the retail receives an iou) and instead he borrow the share and sell it again on the main exchange to short. (tanking the price again.)
* ** they will use the same share and recycle it (borrowing and selling) many times creating multiple iou to broker/retail. my estimation is around 2000% the si.** that’s just my crazy estimation.
* ** parallel to that shitadel create their own trust bond and tied those fake shares to it as collateral, sell them (whoever buys this bonds hold the garbage), get a shit ton of money (fake shares money)
-issued-600m-worth-of-bbb-rated-bonds/
** with that money he can get a shit ton of liquidity to then keep shorting and backing everything with good “margin”
* **not only shorting gme (tons of other companies). those ones need to seem legitimate and have real money backing them up (bonds money) so no margin call if the sec comes asking. so they need real money for that. so it’s “all legal and legitimate”**
* **while the company bankrupts, they keep shorting and shorting with those naked shares created to drop the price, once they used them too many time they dump them into a bank etf (that also tann the price in the main exchange btw! also “hiding” the naked share).
* **then they bankrupt the company**
* two big things happen here:
* 1) the company shares are worthless so they don’t need to return any naked share they produced (and i think they don’t even need to pay tax on the difference they make)
* 2) they made a shit ton of money on betting against the company with options (puts) predicting the company is going down (while manipulating the price the whole time.
* **when the company is worthless then is the best change for shitadel to buy the business super cheap! they also buy the busines debt providing leverage to the banks^.
*
* ^ they previously flooded the banks etfs with heaps and heaps of naked shares and when they rebuy the company they buy the debt back from the banks. providing a big leverage (piece of the bank inside).
*
* **now shitadel and friends own a lot of businesses and business debt meaning the have big leverage on the banks^.
^read bellow to understand what banks are made of now**
* **owning big pieces of the major banks means they own big part of the federal reserve bank(the machine that goes brrrrr) so they own pieces of business, banks and federal reserve!!**
shitadel went for all!!!
this is only partnlf the fuckery!!! they are doing something big on the options (puts/calls) department!
#**let’s go trough everything explained**
note: this was accelerated by the pandemic big time!
what is a holding?
-insights/using-a-holding-company-operating-company-structure-to-help-mitigate-risk
are banks holdings?
_holding_company
from wikipedia:
[2008 credit crisis
as a result of the global financial crisis of 2008, many traditional investment banks and finance corporations such as goldman sachs, morgan stanley,[3] american express, cit group and gmac (now ally financial)[4] converted to bank holding companies in order to gain access to the federal reserve's credit facilities.]
mind blowing!!! **alert alert!!**
take a deep breath and be ready. what you are going to find out is gonna blow your mind.
#**lets starts the journey**
a fellow ape drop this little document in here that pretty much connected the pieces of the puzzle (confirming they are using bonds strips as collateral to sell overseas in different currencies)
-21-087103/
this basically says that kenny and friends are funding heaps of companies in different countries: brazil, portugal, hong kong, cayman islands, spain, mexico, virgin islands, philippines with a high interest rate of over 12% and receiving treasury bonds strips as collateral and huge leverage. at the same time they are taking advantage of the exchange rates to make huge $$$ out of it.
—————
also digging into some clues of rab mentioning qsr led us to find out what a holding is and how it works for later on
also, what’s a qsr?

big example of a qsr is rbi
_brands_international
this information lead me to understand what a holding is, in this case rbi holding is basically a basket of a few fast food restaurants out together. like and etf!!!
anyway… let’s move forward.
**this is what i got. this is it, the whole thing, the whole fukery!!**
**im gonna divide this in two parts… micro and macro view (macro for the big scope of things, micro for more details about it).**
let’s get into the hard part!
——————————-
**macro:**
so kenny has been shorting this companies for a reason:
it makes him a shit ton of money yes. is that his goal tho? no.
he’s goal is to be the king of everything and own everything. but how shorting companies is helping him achieve that?
we found out trough qsr and rbi that there is something called a company being a holdings. what does that mean?
that this business hold the assets of other business in one basket (in the rbi specific case they own burguer king, horton cafes and popeyes). is the basket of those businesses stock and performs according to those companies performance.
after the 2008 housing market collapse, major banks decided to change their structure to… guess….. fucking holdings!….(filled up the pieces of many private institutions they lent money to (businesses, hendgefjnds, etc), people they lent money to (mortgages, auto loans, student loans, etc) and money they lent to the government ).
**the federal reserve is privately owned (not part of the government and instead is sanctioned and backed by it) by the 12 reserve banks and the % (they are the top contributors to the reserve, whaaaaat?)**
well… think about every company borrowing money from a bank and putting their assets as collateral (putting that stock collateral inside the banks basket/pool, mainly etfs), now the bank owns part of the company on form of debt collateral. the bigger the company debt the bigger part of the pie the bank owns as collateral right? big leverage!
[also, some etfs are pretty much a basket/pool full of many many company shares that suppose to be the collateral for the debts. some others are filled with as packages of people’s debt (student loans, mortgages, etc). others full of government debt to the banks.
**put all those shares and pieces (could be turned into liquidity if sold in case of company liquidation or too much risk) and their liquidity backing of cash (people’s bank accounts deposited) and that’s what the bank is made of. correct me if i’m wrong on the comments please.
the banks own leverage on those companies they lend money too.
**now let’s go back to kenny g**
kenny has been shorting this companies (including gme) to bankrupt them or lowering their stock prices not for the sole purpose of cash out the bankruptcy no no!
he’s been doing it so he then rebuys the company at almost nothing and when he does so guess what….. hes buying their debt, so its buying leverage against the banks!!!… (counter leverage opposite as what the bank is doing when lend money, this way kenny has the money and the bank don’t want to return the shares in a big loss!!)
remember the bank is a holding!
kenny and kids (melvin, susquehanna and other baby hedge funds) have been shorting over and over to own leverage against the banks for daddy kenny.
thats not all!!
while the company is not yet bankrupt ….
shitadel mm make trust bonds, pack them with all the fake gme naked shares inside and sell them as if they were full of valuable real gme (the system don’t recognize fakes from reals right?)
-xpm-2006-12-08-0612080128-
-issued-600m-worth-of-bbb-rated-bonds/
get tons of money now!
his process is extremely complex, he uses algorithms to move the money constantly and very fast, buying t-bonds, mortgages, short more companies and etc.
-21-087103/
remember this file? kenny and other banks are funding other business in many other countries giving them money and taking advantage or the transaction rates and well as charging interests rates higher than 12% and backing those with treasury bonds strips! it’s all there in the doco have a look!
that’s one way they use the money from they fake bonds and all the fake shares (so it’s easy just to make more fake shares , pack them in trust bonds and sell them!)
the ones who buy those shitadel trust bonds are the bag holders!! they are buying bonds that are full of shit!!
so at this point he successfully has treasury bonds as leverage from money he gathered from packing fake shares…. (non existent naked gme shares. big scam!), also lent some money overseas with the same money, huge interest rates and made money with the conversion rates!
**so this way he is recycling all the worthless made up naked shares he already used to drive the price down until the company goes bankrupt, 60% of the time he was right everytime (anchorman quote), he’s been succeeding with this!!**
once the company bankrupt, he is successfully draining the money from the company, from the retail shareholder and for all the people that bought those trust bonds!!
while making a shit ton of money from non existing shares packed in binds of shit!
**now the company bankrupts**
kenny then buys the company shares at almost nothing!! (and the company debt)
so now he has huge leverage against the banks/treasury by wanting to buy back the shares the bank don’t want to sell at big losses!
**he flood banks etfs with those naked trash shares and know he has huge leverage!**
remember thag he is doing that with fake made up shares so its not even real money!! biggest scam ever!
pisses me off! honestly
[this is kenny personal vendetta against banks and to own everything!]
so his purpose is to be the biggest king
in the finance by owning so many companies, so much leverage in the banks while using the money he makes with the naked trust bonds to buy land, art and lend money to companies overseas. remember greensill??? now stating to ring a bell?
kenny’s babies (melvin, susquehanna and friends) now also have massive leverages and doing the same style of work kenny is doing in a smaller scale.
that way they can control everything!
so kenny ultimately wants to own everything, be too big to be untouchable and bigger than any bank or the treasure. is been doing this trick pretty much since 2008 with this predatory behavior!!!
**so where gme comes to play?**
gme resisted and didn’t break, instead went up!
kenny then tried harder and harder to break it (keep doubling and doubling down), but he didn’t expect retail to be so resilient and not give up, also he didn’t expect rc to come and transform the company!!!
rc did something that most of us don’t see as a big deal, but is a massive fu**ing deal.
he got rid of the debt!!! now gme is free!! fuming bloody genius! all power to the shareholders, power to the players!
another thing that fits the puzzle is…
shitadel and friends are part of the dtcc but so are big banks!
makes sense to me why the dtcc is now making all this rules… to protect the banks from shitadel and friends predatory behavior as well as them not to suffer when shitadel and friends fall due to gme!!!
dtcc is not in the wrong side of the equation, they were just manipulated by kenny big time! bloody scammy kenny!

————-
the micro:
**this is when tits get totally jacked**
in the pandemic the government gathered trillions (i think something like ). that money came mainly from overseas countries giving money in exchange of treasury bonds strips to help the government for the stimulus packages.
then kenny came to certain president promising that if he borrow that money he will then return the money for the stimulus plus to pay the debt and more.
he was going to be the savior of the people!! giving stimulus to everyone and saving the country!
how the government gave the stimulus to people if kenny had the money?
the government printed the money for the stimulus and gave it to the people.!!!
(remember that 1/5 of the total money has been printed in the last year and a half, machine goes brrrrr).
now kenny has over 2 trillion to play with. ohhh no! play time for kenny!
kenny took those trillions and short gme and other companies!! using the methods we well know from above.
then he made those trust bonds filled with empty naked shorts tons of more times!
but…. he fucked up with gme.
if kenny succeeded bankrupting gme, the money for the stimulus and to pay the 2.2 trillion would of come from the pocket of the retail investors of those companies as well as the assets and money of the companies themselves and also from his trust bond scams (the people that bought his trust bonds!)
destroying the economy, stopping technology and so many people fuc**ed and unemployed!
really kenny?
he also lent more and more money overseas to win with the transaction rates and the juicy 12%+ interest rates.
then wanted to cover everything and blaming the pandemic obviously!
the treasury would of use that money to cover the hole made by the stimulus, pay the debt to other countries and happy days for kenny boy!!
win-win for kenny and hiving him more leverage against the banks/reserve while fooking shorting good business like gme and scamming everyone else!!!
**our video games, boardgames and pikachus going to kenny! fu*k no!**
but then the %, the government and banks realized that gme wasn’t going bankrupt and that kenny was scamming and probably not giving the money back, so now they are poised to claim their moneyzzzz, so do we!!!
but that’s not all!!
kenny now is trapped but then he know that the banks have a big bubble he created dumping all those fake shares on etfs filled by naked non existent shares of companies and huge leverage! he is shorting the banks and fucking the %!!!
why? because kenny don’t want wanted to be the bag holder!! also he always wanted to be a bank and be part of that elite club and they didn’t let him in because he wasn’t born into the % (that’s mainly why he’s seeking revenge!!)
sorry kenny! you can’t buy your way into the % club, you need to born with the surname kenny. kenny no likey  percento nada!
he’s been issuing years after years those bad bad useless trust bonds and everyone buys them thinking are solid gold from shitadel!
**how’s is the % is fighting back??**
creating a bubble too big to handle in gme so they can breaks the citadel (kenny and friends) and margin call them before the federal reserve implodes!!!
but they need to come up with firewalls and ways to protect all the banks and members of the dtcc that are not part of the shitadel and friends scam!! that’s why all those rules coming in place.
once everything is ready then shitadel and friends are gonna be margin called, then forced to close the naked shorts in the etfs as well as in those garbage trust bonds full of empty shells.
**remember that kenny need to return those borrowed naked ious and put a real share in the empty shell on peoples accounts and bonds!!**
but there is more! don’t forget the bets!
**forgot about the  ftd plus all the puts accumulated for years that expire 1/16 a 4/16 (yes dfv day!!) and 6/16!!?** that’s another massive fukery scam going on and is huge!
treasury and friends need to break citadel before citadel break them! economy and the government among scamming everyone and bankrupting companies!!
holy fuc*****ing sh***it!!!
apes are the last line of defense!!!!! protect the economy from predator kenny g!!!
buy and hold!
now remember, when was the last time uncle sam didn’t get his money? i think i can’t remember..
**because uncle sam always gets his money!!, and he’s coming for the money back from kenny and our tendies!! all of them!!**
**this is citadel (kenny and friends) vs the dtcc, federal reserve and the banks!!**
epic fight!!
more than ever fellow ape **buy and hold!!**
i wouldn’t be surprised if kenny is in the deep with something around 2000%+ si no joke.
**remember trump calling ken out in his speech? kenny is hiding with all his money somewhere. he’s also been hiding it in art and real estate:**
***the federal reserve and retail money!***
**kenny and citadel have liquidity to fight for now, but the machine stopped printing, it’s just matter of time.**
so far been kicking the cans with fukery like this one

to hedgefunds!!! they borrowed money from banks for almost no interest rates no matter how the economy and inflation was, including during an unprecedented pandemic!!! for what? shorting kenny style!
wtf?? now you wonder why during a pandemic the whole market was “healthy” and up and growing right?? inflating business with naked shares..
using the same citadel strategy but with money from the banks and washing everything trough citadel mm, bonds and dumping all the garbage in the etfs and the trust bonds buyers.
always betting in bankrupting the companies and then rebuying them to own pieces of the banks/federal reserve.
this might margin call a lot of the banks that need to show collateral for all the shitty loans they been giving to the hedgefunds and shit business and institutions too. lots of banks are gonna be fucked and margin called.
retail and covid are gonna be blamed and there is gonna be crisis, but everything is gonna be fine and tendies will be paid.
the tax from the tendies will come back to the governments and smooth things. inflation is also a healthy thing in every economy, it’s gonna be bad in certain areas but good for other areas so don’t worry too much.
they will print and the system will heal. don’t worry.

a bit of a history lesson. if you want to keep reading
**part 1: from gold-backed to usd oil-to fiat backed**
most currencies have an asset to back them up. most countries use gold. usd used to be backed in gold. somewhere around the line (fellow ape told me was nixon in 1970-71)
-day-in-history/fdr-takes-united-states-off-gold-standard
a certain us president went to the uae and saudi arabia and secured the deal of the lifetime.
-petrodollars-affect-us-
he agreed to purchase all the oil that came from the area as well as providing security, stability and protection. the only condition was **they have to deal oil in usd only**. massive fu\*\*\*ing deal. pretty much means that every transaction involving oil has to use usd meaning that banks will get a cut for every transaction and conversion made.
-dollar-system-crumbles-us-dollar-could-collapse-from-the-worlds-oil-wars/
we still trying to transition from petrodollar to something else….. anyway. let’s gooo!!
be ready to be fucking mind blown!! at the end of this dd your tits are gonna be as jacked as every and your hand so hardened!! buy and hold is the only way!
*\*tin foil hat conspiracy theory time\*:* pretty much every major war we been having post 2000 has been because of that. think the war on terror/bin laden, iraq, hussein , syria/gadaffi, etc.
**why?**
because these countries wanted to deal oil cutting the middle man, they dare to deal oil in a different currency cutting big deals straight with russia, china, north korea and any country that doesn’t want to use usd to buy petrol from them. yes, the whole terrorism and rambo fight for freedom was just a cover-up. the us was making a statement punishing every regimen and country that dares to challenge their supremacy and deal in another currency, as well as having control of the precious oil. yikes!"

velcan holdings : annual results 2020 - stable financial results but decrease of the net income. t press release luxembourg, 30 th  april 2021 : annual results 20 20 stable financial results  but decrease of the net income due to disappointing operations in brazil and india  non audited key consolidated figures 20 20 201 9 var % revenues (eur m) 2. 5 2. 8 -12 % ebitda (eur m) - 2.0 -1. 4 -4 5% net income (eur m) 2. 1 3 . 6 -4 1 % shareholders’ equity (eur m) 1 16 1 21 -4 % cash and financial assets 10 5 103 +1 %  closed 2020 with a net result, group share, of eur  compared to eur  in 2019. this decline essentially stems from, on one hand a drop of the brazilian operational result due to a very low generation coupled with a massive depreciation of the brazilian currency and on the other hand an increase of the impairment of the indian projects, leading to an overall decline of the result. the ebitda is also down by 45% ( eur - in 2020 vs eur -1.4 m in 2019). net financial gains, which amounted to eur  , were almost stable compared to eur  in 2019, mostly because of the reallocation of the portfolio from corporate bonds to equity and commodities. shareholder’s equity decreased by 4% mainly due to the share buyback programs executed in 2020 (492 k shares bought back in 2020, for a total price of eur  ). during 2020, the  continued developing its hydropower concessions located in india (571 mw), and operated its rodeio bonito hydropower plant (15 mw) in brazil . the uncertainties and deadlocks of the indian hydropower market remained, as in 2019, and prevented progress of the projects, leading to an additional provision or eur 2.8 million (20%) for fy 2020 on the intangible value of the indian projects. this brought the total provision to eur 7.1 million (50%), considering the previously booked provisions. this additional provision was already accounted for in the 2020 half yearly results published in october 2020 . the rodeio bonito plant generation was historically low, 40% below the 2019 generation, as a result of the severe draught in the south of brazil which led to an increase of the payments to the mre system 1 . at constant foreign exchange rates the turnover has grown (+18%) thanks to the inflation of selling prices. in euro the turnover is down by 12% ( eur 2.5 m in 2020 vs eur 2.8 m in 2019) because of the massive depreciation of the brazilian currency in 2020 (-41%). financial year 20 20 – management comments on the business india the hydroelectric concessions obtained in 2007 in the state of arunachal pradesh could not make significant progress, due to several long lasting administrative and regulatory impediments, aggravated by the covid-19 pandemic. the techno-economic clearance (tec), environmental clearance, forest clearance as well as most of the post tec investigations being complete for the tandem heo-tato-1 (426 mw), the main next development steps for these 2 projects are the land acquisition, the transport infrastructure, the amendment of the concession agreements, the stage 2 forest clearance and the preliminary search for a bankable power purchase agreement (ppa). these steps however essentially fall under the purview and responsibility of the state and central governments. during 2020 the land acquisition procedure conducted by the state government was halted due to a stoppage of the land survey by several land owners who physically prevented the district administration to enter some parts of the land, complaining about land ownership disputes and claiming immediate financial compensations. the discussions initiated between the state government and the concerned owners in february 2020 were suspended due to the covid-19 outbreak, as the required meetings could happen only physically. the procedure could restart only in february 2021 . all the on-site surveys and boundary markings were completed by the  in march 2021 , without interruption. as of the date of this press release, the group has not received the official survey report and list of land owners from the . however the group’s team attended each survey and it is the group understanding that significant parts of the land requirement have again been registered by the  as being under ownership dispute, and that the survey may lead to an increase of disputed areas as compared to earlier lists established by the state government. the group does not know yet if and how the government of arunachal pradesh (goap) will settle these disputes and find a solution that will allow permanent site access and the projects’ implementation. considers that, as per the current concession agreement and applicable regulations, the land acquisition process and ownership disputes settlement are the exclusive responsibility of the licensing government. the concession contract provides for an extension of the development period in case of any delay which is not the responsibility of the developer. negotiations with the goap, for the amendment of the concession agreement, relate to the development timeframe, but also to the amendment of the allocated capacities (still 380mw in the current concession agreement) and other important terms, have not progressed since 2018. this has led to the impossibility to renew the tecs of the heo and tato-1 (426 mw) tandem in 2020, as such renewal required either a concession agreement up to date with the 426 mw capacity approved by cea, or a non-objection certificate (noc) from the goap. tecs of heo and tato-1 hep, granted in 2015 for 3 years and already extended a first time in 2018 for 2 years, were bearing validities until on 27 th  july 2020 and 28 th  october 2020 respectively. applications for renewals of both tecs were submitted to cea, which requested the group to obtain from goap a (noc) acknowledging that the goap has no objection to the renewal of the projects tecs for the current capacities of 240 mw and 186 mw. after several discussions the goap refused, on 1 st  october 2020 , to issue a noc unless the concession agreements were amended under conditions entailing significant financial costs, some of which the group does not agree with. after requesting a draft amendment to the goap during q4 2020, without success, the group finally sent its own proposed draft amendment in q1 2021. its main provisions relate to the allocated installed capacities, the administrative fees, the development timeframe, the obligations of both parties, and the increase of the free power to the goap against the withdrawal of its potential equity participation in the projects. the provisions have been proposed by the group considering the historical difficulties and the ground reality of the projects and of the indian hydropower market. as of the date of this press release, the discussions are going on with the goap, but both tecs of heo and tato-1 hep are technically not valid anymore, and their renewal is depending on the execution of the revised concession agreement (in addition to the cea renewal procedure). the road infrastructures have kept progressing at a slow pace during 2020 as they did in previous years. no progress has been made by the  regarding the acceleration of the overall completion schedule. the scheduled dates of completion of the roads upgrade up to the projects site are still scheduled theoretically in 2022, but will most likely face significant delays of 2 to 3 years given that for some stretches the technical studies have not yet even been completed. on the forest clearance side, the renewal of the stage-i clearance has been applied for in september 2020 and is still under progress as of date. the group continued to explore the indian market and to conduct its preliminary search for a ppa during 2020. all the major indian power traders (ppa brokers) and distribution companies (discoms) contacted for heo and tato-1 either declined to take up a commercial discussion for a ppa or did not respond. the continued lack of appetite of the market for hydropower ppas results from the commercial and financial indian market conditions, which remained the same during 2020 and still do not fulfil the requirements for the long term and bankable sale of hydropower. the market remained constrained by the lack of appropriate regulatory framework for such bankable ppas, the stressed financial position of electricity distribution companies (discoms) and the indirect competition of cheap solar and wind power. grid stability and the requirement for peak power 2 have also become a growing issue for run-of-the-river (ror, hence with no storage) hydro projects such as heo and tato-1 heps. two years after the announcement of the new hydropower policy by the , a first part of the long awaited implementation regulation has finally be issued, imposing a hydropower purchase obligation (hpo) on discoms, setting a percentage of power that shall be procured by them from hydropower sources between 2021 and 2030. these percentages range from % to % and are remarkably lower than those of solar power, currently at % for 2021. the question is raised within the industry whether these provisions will be sufficient to trigger a general revival of the hydropower sector and enough demand for long term bankable ppas for projects which are not yet under construction. despite the above issues, the group’s projects are the only hydropower projects of such size in india owned and developed by a foreign investor. they are amongst the most advanced private projects and present competitive techno-economic and environmental features. despite long term promising prospects, the current indian power market and especially the hydropower sector are still characterized by a lot of uncertainties. the groups’ projects have been heavily delayed several years in a row. these delays and uncertainties have been reflected in an additional provision of eur 2.8 million (20% of gross value) decided for first semester 2020 on the intangible value of the indian projects. this brought the total provision to eur 7.1 million (50% of gross value), considering the cumulated provisions booked in previous years ( eur  or 30% of gross value). the indian projects activities have been detailed in chapter  of the annual report available at . brazil the rodeio bonito hydropower plant (15 mw) recorded a historically low production of 29 496 mwh in 2020, 40% below the 2019 generation (49 113 mwh in 2019) and close to its all-time record low of 2012 (24 793 mwh). however the turnover when expressed in the brazilian currency (brl) was up thanks to the inflation and the mre system. but as a result of this very low electricity generation and the national low hydro generation in 2020, the plant had to compensate the mre system, which was in a negative position. this is why payments to the mre were much higher, reaching eur  in 2020 vs. eur  in 2019. as a result the ebitda of the plant amounted to brl  against brl  in 2019, down by 13%. when converted in euro, the ebitda of the plant was significantly lower to eur  vs  in 2019 (-51%) mostly due to a 34% depreciation of the average rate of the brazilian real vs euro currency in 2020. financial assets also continued to manage actively its treasury throughout a complicated year marked by the covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the financial markets. the group executed an important reallocation of its investments in other asset classes. the group started the year with a portfolio invested at approximately 60% in bonds, mostly high yield corporate ones. this bond portfolio was reduced by approximately half in january and february, as the rewards seemed not any more commensurate with the potential default risks. since the march 2020 market crunch, the group has gradually changed its asset allocation to include more exposure to equity and commodities (mostly gold). as of 31 st  december 2020 , the bonds exposure, including t-bills, was reduced to 19% of the portfolio (64% as of 31/12/19), whereas the rest of the portfolio of cash, financial assets and financial liabilities ( eur 104.5 m) included:  a negative net cash position of eur 9.3 m (-9% of the portfolio) versus a positive net debt position of eur 27.2 m in 2019 (25% of the portfolio), 19% of gold related exposure (versus 1% as of 31/12/2019), 21% of oil related stocks (none as of 31/12/2019), 4% of silver related stocks (none as of 31/12/2019), 42% of equity (excluding oil) long positions (7% as of 31/12/2019), 4% of equity short positions (2% in 2019), 1% in private equity and credit (3% in 2019).  while reallocating its financial assets towards equity, the group has invested in companies which were trading at historically low prices and could benefit from the improvement of the covid-19 situation. the two sectors hence selected were banking and energy. this strategy of reallocation of the financial assets proved profitable as the group net financial assets rose from eur 103 million to eur 105 million and the financial result amounted to eur 7.7 m as of 31/12/2020, stable when compared to 2019 (eur 8.1 m) and despite the covid-19 crisis. given the current very low levels of benchmark rates in all developed markets ( usa , europe and japan ), the group does not anticipate it will increase again its investments in corporate bonds in the medium term. the group has reduced significantly its financial exposure to the usd and increased its exposure to the euro and the japanese yen. as of 31/12/2020 the group financial assets were exposed notably to the us dollars (35% against 67% in 2019), the japanese yen (25% against 2% in 2019) and the euro (22% against 9% in 2019). it is to be noted that the gold and silver positions are priced in usd and as such are included in the former usd exposure. contrary to the previous years, the group has fully invested its cash and has used some leverage (see above / net cash position) the financial portfolio is detailed in part i, section  of the annual report 2020 available at . during the year  continued to execute buyback programs in order to provide liquidity to shareholders wishing to sell their shares. the shares are bought back in view of their cancellation or to cover for new grants of free shares. a total of 492,348 shares were bought back in 2020, for a total price of eur 3,131,696 . 275,000 shares were cancelled in april 2020 and, as of 31 st  december 2020 ,  held 314,023 own shares representing % of its share capital. foreseeable evolution of the group: after the closing of this financial year, the group is pursuing the following main objectives as a priority for fy 2021:  pursuing the development of the indian hydropower projects. on the short term, executing the required amendment to the concession agreements of the indian hydropower projects, in order to secure the renewal of the tecs and the renewal of forest clearances. continue the active management of its diversified financial investments;   the ability of the group to pursue these objectives is subject to the evolution of the current covid-19 crisis, which may affect both the development of the indian projects and the financial portfolio. financial year 2020 – management comments on the unaudited consolidated financial statements income statement (unaudited consolidated) turnover amounted to eur  (against eur  in 2018, a 12% decrease), mainly from electricity sales in brazil . the turnover in local currency increased by 18% with the inflation on electricity sale prices. however, the depreciation of the brazilian currency vs the euro currency was responsible for a 34% decrease of the turnover in euro. the current operating result amounted to eur - (against - in 2019):  payments to the mre (energy reallocation mechanism) were eur  in 2020 vs. eur  in 2019. depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets of rodeio bonito plant amounted to eur  ( eur  in 2019), while depreciation on intangible projects under development was eur 2.8 vs an amount of eur  in 2019, due to the provision passed on indian projects. staff expenses amounted to eur  in 2020 vs eur  in 2019. the group employed on average 20 permanent employees in 2020. external expenses are totaling eur  in 2020 vs eur  in 2019.  net financial gain for the group amounted to eur  in 2020 mostly because of the reallocation strategy from bonds to equity and commodities markets and despite the usd depreciation (-9% compared to end of 2019) and its impact on the group’s cash and financial assets position. the impact of this depreciation has been managed by the currency reallocation strategy of the group, avoiding bigger potential forex losses (see breakdown per currency in chapter  of the annual report). this gain of  compares to eur  in 2019. in 2020, other operating income ( eur  ) consisted mainly of earn out gains on brazilian assets related to brazilian assets divested in previous years. this figure was nil in 2019. income tax expense amounted to eur - in 2020, same as in 2019. the net result, group share, was eur  in 2020 fy compared to eur  in 2019. the group’s ebitda reached eur - compared to eur - in 2019. the strong depreciation of brl (-41%) and inr (indian currency -12%) closing rates when compared to euro, at 2020 closing date, has heavily and negatively impacted the other comprehensive income, as the group’s main tangible and intangible investments have been done in local currency ( eur - in 2020 against eur - in 2019). the total comprehensive income amounts to a loss of eur - in 2020 against a gain of eur  in 2019. balance sheet  –  assets (unaudited consolidated) net intangible assets stands at  in 2020 and are down by eur  versus 2019, mostly because of the provision of eur - of indian assets, the depreciation of the indian currency ( eur - ) and the brazilian currency ( eur - ) despite the addition of eur  of capitalized costs on indian projects. net tangible assets stands at  in 2020 and decreased by eur  between 2019 and 2020, mainly because of depreciation of the rodeio bonito plant ( eur - ) and the depreciation of the brazilian currency ( eur - ). cash, cash equivalent assets and financial assets (net of current financial liabilities) have increased from eur 103m in 2019 to eur 105m in 2020 (+1%) mainly thanks the good performance of the group’s financial portfolio and despite the share buyback programs. financial assets consist mainly in listed equity, bonds and commodities related stocks. finally total assets increased by 15.3% during 2020 fy (up by eur 18.9 m), mostly because of the bank overdraft facility described in below as part of the “liabilities” and the related asset purchases. at 31 st  december 2020 , the group ( and its subsidiaries) holds 314,023 own shares (2019: 146,810). at year end closing price of eur  those own shares have a market value of eur  . balance sheet –  liabilities (unaudited consolidated) non-current provisions and other non-current liabilities amount to eur  and eur  at 31 december 2020 respectively and arise from litigations related to the 2 biomass plants previously owned by the group (satyamaharshi smpcl – 7.5 mw and rithwik rppl – 7.5 mw, owned between 2006 and 2010). the existing provision represents the major part of the claims as well as accumulated interests and judicial expenses. trade and other payables amount to eur 0.9 m vs eur  in 2019 (due to eur 0.3 m of payable related to mre payments in brazil , due in early 2021 but related to 2020 generation). current financial liabilities of eur 23.9 m in 2020 (vs nil in 2019) are related to overdraft facilities granted by a brokerage firm to the group to leverage its listed investments trading activities. under this facility, securities held in the trading account are used as a security to borrow money. this facility has enabled the group to leverage its investments and maximize its profits. but it is to be noted that leverage works both ways and could also cause higher losses in case of fall in market prices. own shares, booked directly against the equity of the group at their historical cost, reduce the net shareholder’s equity of the group by eur - at 31 st  december 2020 versus eur - at 31 st  december 2019 following the share buyback programs ( eur - ), the capital reduction ( eur + ) and the use of shares to cover share based payments ( eur + ). as at 31 st  december 2020 , unrealized losses on conversion reserves, booked directly against the equity amounted to eur - versus an unrealized loss of eur - at 31 st  december 2019 , as the brl and inr currencies heavily depreciated vs eur currency in 2020. with a consolidated equity of eur  ( -eur  compared to 2019), the group still has no significant net debt as of 31 st  december 2020 , though it should be noted it uses leverage (cf. the leverage facility mentioned earlier). the full annual report 20 20 is available at:  accounts next page  summary consolidated financial statements (unaudited)

three points to pay attention to afterwards- &quot;still, i can&#39;t get the high price&quot;. i would like to pay attention to the following three points in the late trading on the 30th.・ the nikkei average has fallen back, &quot;i still can&#39;t get the high price&quot; ・ the dollar / yen pair has fallen, and adjustments have been made for the long holidays. ・ tokyo electron is the top contributor to the price drop, and fanuc is second. i can&#39;t go. ”the nikkei average has fallen back. the previous trading was closed at  yen (estimated trading volume of 600 million shares), which was  yen lower. the tokyo market on the 29th was closed on showa day, but during this period, the dow jones industrial average fell by $ 164 on the 28th and rose by $ 239 on the 29th. federal reserve chairman jerome powell said it was &quot;not the time to discuss&quot; the reduction in asset purchases, and was aware of the prolonged monetary easing, as well as expectations for large-scale fiscal policy following president biden&#39;s policy address. also increased. in addition, real gross domestic product (gdp, preliminary figures) for the january-march quarter increased significantly by 6.4% annually from the previous quarter. however, in the tokyo market after the holidays, there are still some stocks that are pushed to sell due to the settlement of accounts, and the nikkei average starts from 57 yen depreciation. after that, there were some scenes where it was reluctant to lower, but aggressive trading was limited due to the interval of golden week, and it temporarily dropped to  yen ( yen depreciation) toward the front closing. on an individual basis, sony g fell 6% at the top of trading value. although it is not possible to make a simple comparison due to changes in accounting standards, it seems that sales are rising due to the profit reduction plan for this term. murata also fell by more than 3% due to the negative view of the slowdown in profit growth this term. in addition, toyota itself is weak in the top trading value, and first lite is a little cheap. nidec fell by nearly 4%. in addition, sms and others are appearing at the top of the tse 1st section decline rate. on the other hand, softbank g and nintendo are small. hitachi metals surged to the tob price following the announcement of a takeover bid (tob) by a us fund. keyence, hitachi, and fujitsu have been heavily bought by the stocks whose financial results have been announced, and cyber has appeared at the top of the tse first section growth rate. in the sector, transportation equipment, rubber products, glass and earth and stone products, etc. have the highest rate of decline. on the other hand, steel, shipping, land transportation, etc. had the highest rate of increase. the number of stocks on the first section of the tokyo stock exchange is 37% of the total, while the number of stocks on the first section is 59%. today&#39;s nikkei average has returned to the front with a three-digit decline. there were occasions when i was reluctant to lower it, but it seems that it is difficult to buy because of the interval of golden week. looking at the trading value of the first section of the tokyo stock exchange, it is not a little less than 1.4 trillion yen so far, but considering that it is swelling reasonably due to the settlement of accounts of major companies, it seems that aggressive trading is still scarce. the financial results of major companies vary. i get the impression that it has improved compared to the beginning of the financial results announcement season, when nidec, m3, etc. plunged one after another. however, if you look at keyence, you can think of it as a reaction to the sale in advance due to the sense of caution about the financial results reaction. recently, the number of new high-priced stocks has continued to be at a double-digit pace, and it does not seem that there has been a change in the keynote on a breaking news basis so far today. after all, even if there are movements to review financial results and short-term transactions, it is still in the mood of &quot;going to get high prices&quot;. however, under these circumstances, the reason why fujitsu set a new year-to-date high (17250 yen) during trading hours in january is that &quot;digital transformation (dx)&quot; is recognized as a long-term investment theme. makes you feel. mothers index continues to fall to -% in emerging markets. mothers trading value on the 28th has fallen to the 110 billion yen level, and it seems that it is being pushed by selling for the closing of credit buying in the thin business. the balance of credit purchases at the time of application on the 23rd announced by the tokyo stock exchange on the 27th (tokyo / nagoya 2 markets, total of institutional credit and general credit) was  trillion yen (up 102.9 billion yen from the previous week). it is said that it was the highest level in 2 years and 10 months, while the selling balance was 707.2 billion yen (down 25.7 billion yen), the lowest level in 2 years and 4 months. i would like to determine how much credit buying balance has been sorted out before golden week, but is it still conscious of the weight of the upside in terms of stock supply and demand? by the way, us stocks went up and down during the closing of the tokyo market, but the direction to &quot;continue to ride the rise in the market as before&quot; and &quot;if strong (performance / economy) figures are confirmed, we are reducing risk assets. i get the impression that the directions of &quot;this way&quot; are in conflict. the financial results of major high-tech companies such as &quot;gafam (alphabet (google), apple, facebook, , microsoft)&quot; were still overwhelming, but the reaction to the financial results was mixed. it seems that the investment strategy from here is also divided. the baiden administration and the fed have indicated that they will continue aggressive fiscal spending and monetary easing, but the break-even inflation rate (an indicator of expected inflation rate) has risen to the 2.4% range. it can be seen that there is a deep-rooted sense of caution about the acceleration of inflation. the tokyo market will be closed for five consecutive holidays from tomorrow, during which economic indicators such as business sentiment will be announced one after another in the united states. also, in japan, many announcements of financial results of major companies such as komatsu, tokyo electron, and ana are scheduled today, and it seems that the wait-and-see mood will be strong for later transactions. (daijun kobayashi) ■ dollar / yen pair depreciated, adjustment for large consecutive holidays the dollar / yen pair fell in the tokyo market on the morning of the 30th, dropping from around 109 yen to the latter half of 108 yen. buying of the dollar strengthened toward the midpoint price, but then stalled after a round of buying. with the golden week holidays ahead, sales of adjustments by domestic forces are observed. on the other hand, china&#39;s economic indicators were lower than expected, and it was a little anaerobic. the trading range up to this point is  to  for the dollar / yen,  to  for the euro / yen, and  to  for the euro / dollar. ■ checked stocks in the latter part ・ three stocks such as architects studio japan and soshin electric have stopped high * including temporary stop high (quote price) ・ tokyo electron is the top contributor to price decline, and fanac is second in the ranking ■ economic indicators ・important remarks [economic indicators] ・ effective recruitment rate in japan / march:  times (forecast:  times, february:  times) ・ sun / march unemployment rate: 2.6% (forecast: 2.9%, february: 2.9) %) ・ japan ・ april tokyo metropolitan consumer price index (excluding fresh products): -0.2% year-on-year (forecast: 0.0%, march: -0.1%) ・ japan / march mining and industry preliminary figures: previous month ratio + 2.2% (forecast: -2.0%, february: -1.3%) ・ middle / april manufacturing pmi: 51.1 (forecast: 51.8, march: 51.9) ・ middle / april non-manufacturing pmi: 54.9 ( forecast: 56.1, march: 56.3) [important remarks] ・ ny city &quot;to lift all restrictions on pandemic support by july 1&quot; &lt;domestic&gt; none &lt;overseas&gt; none &lt;&lt; cs &gt;&gt; fisco

ransomware explained: no silver bullet, crooks out of reach. boston: political hand-wringing in washington over russia’s hacking of federal agencies and interference in us politics has mostly overshadowed a worsening digital scourge with a far broader wallop: crippling and dispiriting extortionary ransomware attacks by cybercriminal mafias that mostly operate in foreign safe havens out of the reach of western law  in the united states alone last year were more than 100 federal, state and municipal agencies, upwards of 500 health care centers, 1,680 educational institutions and untold thousands of businesses, according to the cybersecurity firm emsisoft. dollar losses are in the tens of billions. accurate numbers are elusive. many victims shun reporting, fearing the reputational  the while, ransomware gangsters have become more brazen and cocky as they put more and more lives and livelihoods at risk. this week, one syndicate threatened to make available to local criminal gangs data they say they stole from the washington, , metro police on informants. another recently offered to share data purloined from corporate victims with wall street inside traders. cybercriminals have even reached out directly to people whose personal info was harvested from third parties to pressure victims to pay up.“in general, the ransomware actors have gotten more bold and more ruthless,” said allan liska, an analyst with the cybersecurity firm recorded  april 29, a public-private task force including microsoft, amazon, the national governors association, the fbi, secret service and britain and canada’s elite crime agencies delivered to the white house an 81-page urgent action plan for an aggressive and comprehensive whole-of-government assault on  the report’s online launch, homeland security secretary alejandro mayorkas said in a pre-recorded video that the white house is developing a plan for disrupting ransomware and his department “will work to implement many of (the panel’s) recommendations, because one thing is clear: ransomware is a threat to our national security.”mayorkas last month announced a dhs ransomware initiative, and the department of justice has just created a task force to tackle the  did ransomware come from? how does it work?the criminal syndicates that dominate the ransomware business are mostly russian-speaking and operate with near impunity out of russia and allied countries. they are a continuation and refinement - ransomware was barely a blip three years ago - of more than two decades of cyber-thieving that spammed, stole credit cards and identities and emptied bank accounts. the syndicates have grown in sophistication and skill, leveraging dark web forums to organise and recruit while hiding their identities and movements with tools like the tor browser and cryptocurrencies that make payments - and their laundering - harder to  scrambles a victim organisation’s data with encryption. the criminals leave instructions on infected computers for how to negotiate ransom payments and, once paid, provide software decryption  year, ransomware crooks expanded into data-theft blackmail. before triggering encryption, they quietly exfiltrate sensitive files and threaten to expose them publicly unless ransoms are paid. victims who diligently backed up their networks as a hedge against ransomware now had to think twice about refusing to pay. at the end of 2019, only one ransomware group had an extortion site online that would publish such files. now more than two dozen  who refuse to pay can incur costs that far exceed the ransoms they might have negotiated. it happened recently to the university of vermont health network. it suffered an estimated us$ a day in losses in the two months it took to recover. more than 5,000 hospital computers, their data scrambled into gibberish, had to be wiped clean and reconstituted from backed-up  university of california-san francisco, heavily involved in covid-19 research, barely hesitated before paying. it gave the criminals us$ last june. manufacturers have been especially hard-hit this year, with ransoms of us$50mil demanded of computer makers acer and quanta, a major supplier of apple  are these criminals organised?some top ransomware criminals fancy themselves software service professionals. they take pride in their “customer service”, providing “help desks” that assist paying victims in file decryption. and they tend to keep their word. they have brands to protect, after all.“if they stick to their promises, future victims will be encouraged to pay up,” maurits lucas, director of intelligence solutions at the cybersecurity firm intel471, told a webinar earlier this year. “as a victim you actually know their reputation.”the business tends to be compartmentalised. an affiliate will identify, map out and infect targets, choose victims and deploy ransomware that is typically “rented” from a ransomware-as-a-service provider. the provider gets a cut of the payout, the affiliate normally taking more than three-quarters. other subcontractors may also get a slice. that can include the authors of the malware used to break into victim networks and the people running the so-called “bulletproof domains” behind which the ransomware gangs hide their “command-and-control” servers. those servers manage the remote sowing of malware and data extraction ahead of activation, a stealthy process that can take  do ransoms keep climbing? how can they be stopped?in thursday’s report, the task force says it would be wrong to try to ban ransom payments, largely because “ransomware attackers continue to find sectors and elements of society that are woefully underprepared for this style of attack”.the task force recognises that paying up can be the only way for an afflicted business to avoid bankruptcy. worse, the sophisticated cybercriminals often have done their research and know a victim’s cybersecurity insurance coverage limit. they’ve been known to mention it in  degree of criminal savvy helped drive average ransom payments to more than us$310,000 last year, up 171% from 2019, according to palo alto networks, a task force  surprisingly, the still-young cyber-insurance industry is reeling. premiums have gone up by 50% to 100% in the past year as ransomware became the no. 1 claim, said michael phillips, chief claims officer of resilience insurance and a co-chair of the task force. on average, cyber-insurance claim payouts can now exceed 70% of what is paid in premiums - prompting some insurers to drop this type of insurance altogether, industry reports  multi-pronged response to ransomware proposed by the task force will require the kind of concerted diplomatic, legal and law enforcement cooperation with key allies that the trump administration shunned, displacing what the authors call the current “uncoordinated, disjointed” response.“there is no silver bullet, but if we’re going to shift the trajectory of this type of attack the us government has got to get at this with some speed,” said task force co-chair philip reiner, ceo of the nonprofit institute for security and  developers and their affiliates should be named and shamed (they are not always easy to identify) and regimes that enable them punished with sanctions, the report  calls for mandatory disclosure of ransom payments and a federal “response fund” to provide financial assistance to victims - in hopes that, in many cases, it will prevent them from paying ransoms. and it wants stricter regulation of cryptocurrency markets to make it more difficult for criminals to launder ransomware  task force also calls for something potentially controversial: amending the us computer fraud and abuse act to let private industry actively block or limit online criminal activity, including of botnets, the networks of hijacked zombie computers that ransomware criminals use to sow  odds of successfully stifling ransomware are high, the report’s authors acknowledge: “the old adage that a cybercriminal only has to be lucky once, while a defender has to be lucky every minute of every day, has never been more true.”- ap

financial pitfalls nris should avoid while investing in india. first-generation indian migrants are far more likely to return to india annually to visit family, friends, or relatives, attend family events, or travel across the country. during these short trips, they have been known to squeeze in their financial appointments for india-based investment decisions. this hasty process usually leads to critical investment decisions being pushed aside or delegated to relatives or friends, which ultimately leads to financial pitfalls. in our experience with nris, some of the usual pitfalls they are known to fall into and must consciously try to avoid are as follows: investing as a resident  once an individual attains the status of an nri he must convert his existing bank accounts to an nre, nro, or fcnr accounts. as an nri you can open an & nro account that are rupee designated accounts and are repatriable. similarly, investment instruments like mfs , direct equity, bonds, and more have their restrictions. for instance, an nris demat account will need to be converted to an nro demat account, while stock trading activities will need to be routed through a pis (portfolio investment scheme) account. the rules and regulations are ever-changing; keen nri investors need to keep abreast with these changes to avoid falling into the trap of losses. barred investments  often nri’s tend to continue with their residential status-based investment instruments as well, ignoring processes and regulations. for instance, as an nri settled in the usa there are restrictions to which mutual fund houses you are allowed to invest through. this is due to the stringent compliance requirement by the usa & canada’s regulatory body fatca. to avoid the complexities in compliance only a handful of investing houses accept investments from nris residing in the us. for nri’s in other nations continuing with the current mfs may require a simple status change update by submitting the necessary documentation. also read: why nris should use the mutual fund route to investments  the taxation web  tax avoidance or double taxation is another pitfall that most nris fail to account for. income earned in india, which exceeds the specified amount, in the form of interest, dividends from equity shares or mfs, rent, capital gain, etc. become liable for tax filing. in some countries income earned in india could be taxable both in india as well as in the country of the nris residence. to circumvent this double taxation burden on nris a tax treaty better known as the double tax avoidance agreement (dtaa) is signed between india and multiple countries. this treaty assists in tackling the problem of tax avoidance as well as determines the efficient method implied to tax an nri income. this avoids double taxation and offers relief by reducing the burden of taxes on income earned, provided a dtaa provision exists between the two countries. beyond intent, the foremost reason for nris to default on taxes is unawareness linked to the indian tax laws that are constantly changing. zero diversification  tying your portfolio to a single asset class or even a single country’s fate is a gamble. nris often fail to diversify their investments across asset classes and invest in fixed returns assets like fd’s or physical assets like gold and real estate. the reason for this tunneled vision could be correlated to avoidance of the complicated web of regulations, transactional compliances, and taxation by nris. reports suggest nri investments in indian real estate are likely to grow at 12% in fy22. the average prices of properties in leading markets like ncr and mumbai showed flat growth in the october-december period of 2020 as compared to the previous year (2019). falling interest rates too have caused traditional asset classes like fd’s and more to lose their sheen. there are multiple avenues for nris to choose from that are both risky as well as secured. mutual funds, nps , direct equity, ppf , and more are avenues that can be considered based on the financial goals of the investor, be it early retirement, post-retirement planning or simply securing their dependents' future. digital assets  the latest fad of non-fungible tokens nfts and cryptocurrency along with its ambiguity over its legality by indian laws are leaving investors in a tizzy. young nris that are tech-savvy often tend to invest massive amounts of their corpus in such digital assets. owing to its volatility and legal repercussions (especially in india) it is best if investors maintain investing in such assets within their allocated limit ensuring that its uncertainty or volatility does not put their complete financial portfolio at risk. also read: here's a step by step guide for nris to retire rich  controlling outflows  clearing off all forms of debt needs to be top a priority for every investor. first-generation nris who migrate often have loans for a home, education, or personal requirements. they must ensure to plan repayment and pre-payment of these loans from day 1. it is easy to get carried away and spend on lifestyle expenses in a new country. prudent planning ensures you stay in control of your expenses and invest efficiently, especially during these unprecedented times of volatile markets, job cuts, visa delays, and more. as nris, investing in indian markets need not be a burdensome task. today, in the post-pandemic world processes and procedures have swiftly moved to online modes offering investors much transactional ease, even if they are across borders. the indian markets are proving their grit and potential, it is now time for nris to decide if they want to benefit from india’s future potential.

book review | a short history of humanity. how migration made us who we are by johannes krause and thomas trappe humanity has often found itself on the precipice. we’ve survived and thrived because we’ve never stopped moving. in this eye-opening book, johannes krause, chair of the max planck institute for the history of humanity, offers a new way of understanding our past, present and future.  the toughest opponent humanity had ever faced  marshalling unique insights from archaeogenetics, an emerging new discipline that allows us to read our ancestors’ dna like journals chronicling personal stories of migration, krause charts two millennia of adaption, movement and survival, culminating in the triumph of homo sapiens as we swept through europe and beyond in successive waves of migration – developing everything from language, the patriarchy, disease, art and a love of pets as we did so. we also meet our ancestors, from those many of us have heard of – such as homo erectus and the neanderthals – to the wildly unfamiliar but no less real: the recently discovered denisovans, who ranged across asia and, like humans, interbred with neanderthals; the aurignacians, skilled artists who, 40,000 years ago, brought about an extraordinary transformation in what our species could invent and create; the varna, who buried their loved ones with gold long before the pharaohs of egypt did; and the gravettians, big game hunters who were europe’s most successful early settlers until they perished in the face of the toughest opponent humanity had ever faced: the ice age. as well as being a radical new telling of our shared story, this book is a reminder that the global problems that keep us awake at night – climate catastrophe; the sudden emergence of deadly epidemics; refugee crises; ethnic conflict; overpopulation – are all things we’ve faced, and overcome, before.  about the authors  johannes krause is the director of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology and a brilliant pioneer in the field of archaeogenetics—archaeology augmented by dna sequencing technology—which has allowed scientists to reconstruct human history reaching back hundreds of thousands of years before recorded time. thomas trappe is a political journalist but has frequently worked in science journalism and reported several times on johannes krause’

trident royalties plc. q1 2021 activities update. trident royalties (lse:trr) intraday stock chart friday 30 april 2021 tidmtrr rns number : 1474x trident royalties plc. 30 april 2021 30 april 2021 trident royalties plc ("trident" or the "company") q1 2021 activities update transformational lithium royalty acquisition & fundraising, continued strength in commodities trident royalties plc (aim: trr, fsx: 5kv), is pleased to provide an update on its activities undertaken during the first quarter ended 31 march 2021, including q1 royalty receipts. highlights q1 saw a significant increase in battery metals exposure, in conjunction with an oversubscribed equity financing -- trident completed its most significant transaction to-date with the acquisition of a 60% interest in a gross revenue royalty ("grr") over the thacker pass project ("thacker pass"), for a total consideration of us$28.0 million, comprising us$26.0 million in cash and us$2.0 million in new ordinary shares in trident. thacker pass contains the largest defined lithium mineral reserve in the united states; -- a successful concurrent equity financing of approximately gbp20.7 million (approximately us$28.8 million) was conducted at no discount to the prevailing market price to execute the thacker pass lithium royalty transaction and strengthen the balance sheet; -- trident completed the talga gold royalties transaction and, shortly post quarter end, completed the previously announced pukaqaqa copper royalties transaction, finalising the acquisition of these seven royalties; and -- with a portfolio inclusive of copper, iron ore, gold, and now lithium, trident is increasingly reflective of the broader global mining sector, providing investors with an inflation hedge in the face of loose global monetary policy and direct exposure to a once-in-a-generation energy revolution. q1 royalty payments totalling approximately us$451,314 from royalties over producing assets, an increase of 55% over q4 2020 royalty / stream q1 2021 payment cumulative payments since acquisition koolyanobbing iron a$100,479 a$2,740,884 ore royalty (1) --------------------------- ------------------------------- mimbula copper royalty us$375,000 us$453,707 --------------------------- ------------------------------- -- mimbula copper royalty payment of us$375,000 based on the minimum payment schedule ("mps") under the royalty agreement, representing a significant increase over q4 2020. q1 2021 production saw 671 tonnes of copper sold, an increase over q4 2020 as the project continues to ramp up; -- the mps on the mimbula copper royalty continues in 2021 (us$375,000 per quarter in 2021, less any excess payments made above the mps from previous quarters, increasing to us$500,000 per quarter in 2022 and us$750,000 for the first two quarters of 2023)(2) ; -- koolyanobbing iron ore royalty payment of a$100,479 (us$76,314(3) ), a decrease over q4 2020 on higher received price but lower volumes from the royalty area; -- trident notes the average grade at koolyanobbing has fallen from 59% to 57% fe since 2h20. recent unprecedented strength in the iron ore market, particularly for low-grade fines products, may incentivise operators to opportunistically favour production from lower grade areas in the short term.(4) trident's royalty covers a substantial portion of the deception pit, the highest-grade deposit and a significant proportion of the total koolyanobbing reserves. trident anticipates deferred production of this higher quality ore will benefit the company in the short-medium term; -- trident also notes the recent strategy overview presentation by mineral resources limited, the project operator, which highlighted the impending finalisation of a 10-year plan for the yilgarn hub, of which koolyanobbing and its associated infrastructure is the central component. additionally, mineral resources flagged the expansion of the yilgarn hub to 12mtpa as a further growth opportunity; and -- commodity prices underlying trident's royalty portfolio remained strong throughout q1 2021 with iron ore averaging us$131/tonne, copper averaging $8,503/tonne, lithium carbonate equivalent ("lce") averaging us$9,083/tonne, and gold averaging us$1,793 /oz.(5) post quarter end, copper has continued to climb to near 10-year highs, while lce prices have now doubled year-to-date to over us$13,500/tonne. q1 royalty portfolio growth, combined with positive asset-level progress by project operators -- thacker pass lithium project (6) : in january 2021, lithium americas corp ("lac"), the project operator, announced the receipt of the final key federal permit for the project, followed shortly thereafter by a us$400 million equity fundraise primarily to fund the commencement of construction. with the acquisition of 60% of the grr, trident now has exposure to a key global lithium asset with a clear pathway to production. other highlights include: -- thacker pass currently contains a cim compliant mineral reserve of  lce, the largest lithium reserve in the united states, with an anticipated mine life of 46 years based on reserves. -- thacker pass is at an advanced stage of development with a highly attractive pre-feasibility study ("pfs") announced on 21 june 2018 and a definitive feasibility study due for completion in 2021. -- lac has announced that key permits are in place with commencement of construction targeted for late 2021 or early 2022 and trident expects phase 1 production to start ramping up in 2024. -- the grr is subject to a partial operator buy-back which trident expects will be exercised by lac for proceeds to trident of us$13.2 million during the first year of operation (the "buyback"). -- based on the pfs parameters published by lac (including an lce price of $12,000/tonne), phase 1 steady-state royalty revenue attributable to trident is anticipated to be approximately us$3.8 million per annum, increasing to us$7.6 million per annum at phase 2 steady-state (assuming the buy-back occurs before operations commence). -- as anticipated, the third-party claimant has named trident as a party to the existing litigation between orion resource partners regarding the grr. the seller of the royalty has provided trident with an indemnity (subject to customary limitations and exclusions) in respect of such proceedings. -- lake rebecca gold project: apollo consolidated ltd ("apollo"), the project operator, has committed a material budget increase to advance the lake rebecca gold project(7) ("lake rebecca"), de-risking the route to a future development decision: -- apollo has entered into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell its royalty interest over the seguela gold project in cote d'ivoire for a$20m cash. it stated that the sale "will add to existing cash reserves" placing apollo "in a very strong position to take rebecca forward." -- apollo announced the strategic acquisition of additional land tenure around lake rebecca to allow for full operational and planning flexibility as the company moves towards commercial studies(8) . -- apollo recently issued a jorc (2012) compliant mineral resource estimate ("mre") update, providing a 50% increase in indicated mineral resources to 815,000 ounces to a combined total indicated and inferred optimised pit-constrained  ounces gold mineral resource(9) . -- the mre update also noted the commencement of key technical studies to progress a potential +8 year mining and processing operation. with a$ in cash and receivables on hand, apollo remains well funded to aggressively advance lake rebecca(9) . -- additional geotechnical drilling on the eastern side of the lake rebecca deposit will assist in the outline of an optimised open pit shell for the proposed mine; drilling has intersected wide zones of high-grade gold mineralisation in two diamond drill holes located in the footwall of the jennifer structure(10) . -- apollo has stated the results from the two holes open potential for previously unknown structures to the east of the current resource, with intersections up to 16m @  au and  @  au respectively. -- geotechnical drilling elsewhere on the project also intersected significant gold mineralisation. -- spring hill gold project: trident notes the receipt of environmental approval for the spring hill gold project ("spring hill") under the environment protection and biodiversity conservation act (epbc). the approval represents the achievement of a key milestone in the development of spring hill, clearing the way for next steps toward development. -- pukaqaqa copper project: nexa resources sa, the project operator, noted in its 2020 annual filing that the first part of pre-feasibility metallurgical results for the pukaqaqa copper project were concluded in december 2020, "demonstrating better results than previous campaigns, including improved recoveries and grades. during 2021, variability tests to confirm results will be held." the project budget has been increased by 60% from 2020, to us$2.4 million in 2021 to allow for further metallurgical testing and environmental closure works in the drilling area(11) . -- warrawoona gold project: calidus resources ltd ("calidus"), the project operator, is completing an integration study on its blue spec gold deposit to assess the economics of mining blue spec and trucking ore to the nearby warrawoona plant, potentially increasing the robustness of warrawoona by increasing operating margins(12) . in addition, caldius noted in its corporate presentation that warrawoona will "commence main construction this quarter", as well as confirming that construction is fully funded and on schedule to pour first gold as planned in the first half of 2022. -- mosquito creek gold project: calidus has entered into a farm-in agreement with nimble resources(13) , the project operator, which gives calidus the right to earn up to 90% of the mosquito creek tenement e46/1035, located about 75km from its warrawoona gold project and in the vicinity of the blue spec mining proposition. -- e46/1035 is located along strike of two geochemical trends identified on tenements immediately to the west, calidus states that 'many soil and rock-chip anomalies on the tenement have not been previously followed up with drilling' and 'fieldwork will start in earnest this calendar year'. -- koolyanobbing iron ore project: in its q3 fy2021 quarterly results(14) , mineral resources limited stated that 2.5 million tonnes of iron ore were shipped from the yilgarn hub for the quarter. trident holds a 1.5% free-on-board royalty over the m77/1259 tenement which covers a substantial part of the deception pit, which forms part of the broader koolyanobbing iron ore operation in western australia. -- mimbula copper project: production continues to ramp up at the mimbula copper project and, with the copper price recently touching near 10-year highs supported by solid fundamentals, the project is well positioned to capitalise on continued positive market sentiment. strong balance sheet to support future acquisitions -- unaudited cash balance of us$7.4 million as of 31 march 2021 (not inclusive of q1 royalty revenue, which was received post-quarter end); -- this substantial cash balance - coupled with ongoing projected revenues from two cash generative royalties and an ability to offer vendors publicly tradeable equity in trident - supports capacity for future acquisitions; -- in addition, trident entered into a term sheet with tribeca global resources credit pty ltd during q1 in respect of a proposed debt facility up to an amount of us$10 million. the facility is subject to the finalisation of definitive documents and satisfaction of customary conditions precedent; -- indicative of the strength of the pipeline, trident currently has 11 active ndas under which it is reviewing a range of opportunities across commodities including mineral sands, lead, nickel, copper, gold, zinc, cobalt, potash, and iron ore; and -- trident continues to prioritise production or near-production assets in order to materially build trident's near-term revenue profile. adam davidson, chief executive officer of trident commented: "the first quarter of 2021 was perhaps the most significant for trident since its admission to trading on aim less than a year ago, with the $28 million acquisition of 60% of the thacker pass lithium royalty, coupled with a substantial equity raise. the fundraising was conducted at no discount to the prevailing share price, was significantly oversubscribed and has resulted in a number of new institutional holders establishing a position in the company. in addition to funding our thacker pass transaction, we have a very healthy balance sheet to support the continued growth and diversification of our royalty portfolio - both through acquisition as well as positive asset-level progress. this bodes exceptionally well for trident, particularly against a global macro backdrop that is increasingly supportive of growing demand for critical commodities. within the last quarter we've seen material positive updates at lake rebecca, spring hill and the western australian gold royalty package tenements. revenue continues to remain volatile across trident's two paying royalties, a factor which underpins the opportunity available to trident by which it can acquire single asset royalties at attractive valuations from natural sellers, to ultimately construct a diversified portfolio of royalties with a more predictable payment profile. trident remains focused on executing value accretive transactions across the commodity and development space, with a particular focus on enhancing near term revenue." references (1) inclusive of gst (2) source: trident royalties announcement dated 29 june 2020  (3) aud =  usd (31 march 2021) (4) source: mineral resources limited quarterly activities report - q3 fy21 .pdf (5) source: factset, 62% fe (cfr), copper (lme), gold (lbma). lce cif asia (benchmark minerals) (6) source: trident royalties announcement dated 19 march 2021  (7) source: apollo consolidated asx announcement 18 march 2021 https://cdn--gateway/asx/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02355042-6a1025215?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4 (8) source: apollo consolidated asx announcement 2 february 2021 .pdf (9) source: trident royalties announcement dated 22 april 2021  (10) source: apollo consolidated asx announcement 15 february 2021 https://cdn--gateway/asx/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02340937-6a1020176?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4 (11) source: nexa resources 2020 20-f filing for fiscal year ended december 31, 2020 .aspx?idcanal=ny3+tgr+zksy3dsjght06w== (12) source: calidus resources asx announcement 23 march 2021 .pdf (13) source: calidus resources asx announcement 3 february 2021 .pdf (14) source: mineral resource limited asx announcements .pdf competent person's statement the technical information contained in this disclosure has been read and approved by mr nick o'reilly (msc, dic, mausimm, mimmm, fgs), who is a qualified geologist and acts as the competent person under the aim rules - note for mining and oil & gas companies. mr o'reilly is a principal consultant working for mining analyst consulting ltd which has been retained by trident to provide technical support. the information contained within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the market abuse regulations (eu) no. 596/2014 which is part of uk law by virtue of the european union (withdrawal) act 2018. upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain. ** ends ** contact details: trident royalties plc  adam davidson +1 (757) 208-5171 grant thornton (nominated adviser)  colin aaronson / samantha harrison +44 020 7383 5100 / lukas girzadas ---------------------------------------------------------- tamesis partners llp (joint broker)  richard greenfield +44 203 882 2868 ---------------------------------------------------------- shard capital partners llp (joint  broker) +44 207 186 9927 erik woolgar / isabella pierre ---------------------------------------------------------- st brides partners ltd (financial  pr & ir) +44 20 7236 1177 susie geliher / catherine leftley / charlotte hollinshead ---------------------------------------------------------- about trident trident is a growth-focused, diversified mining royalty and streaming company, providing investors with exposure to a mix of base and precious metals, bulk materials (excluding thermal coal) and battery metals. key highlights of trident's strategy include: -- building a royalty and streaming portfolio to broadly mirror the commodity exposure of the global mining sector (excluding thermal coal) with a bias towards production or near-production assets, differentiating trident from the majority of peers which are exclusively, or heavily weighted, to precious metals; -- acquiring royalties and streams in resource-friendly jurisdictions worldwide, while most competitors have portfolios focused on north and south america; -- targeting attractive small-to-mid size transactions which are often ignored in a sector dominated by large players; -- active deal-sourcing which, in addition to writing new royalties and streams, will focus on the acquisition of assets held by natural sellers, such as: closed-end funds, prospect generators, junior and mid-tier miners holding royalties as non-core assets, and counterparties seeking to monetise packages of royalties and streams which are otherwise undervalued by the market; -- maintaining a low-overhead model which is capable of supporting a larger scale business without a commensurate increase in operating costs; and -- leveraging the experience of management, the board of directors, and trident's adviser team, all of whom have deep industry connections and strong transactional experience across multiple commodities and jurisdictions. the acquisition and aggregation of individual royalties and streams is expected to deliver strong returns for shareholders as assets are acquired on terms reflective of single asset risk compared with the lower risk profile of a diversified, larger scale portfolio. further value is expected to be delivered by the introduction of conservative levels of leverage through debt. once scale has been achieved, strong cash generation is expected to support an attractive dividend policy, providing investors with a desirable mix of inflation protection, growth and income. forward-looking statements this news release contains forward -- looking information. the statements are based on reasonable assumptions and expectations of management and trident provides no assurance that actual events will meet management's expectations. in certain cases, forward -- looking information may be identified by such terms as "anticipates", "believes", "could", "estimates", "expects", "may", "shall", "will", or "would". although trident believes the expectations expressed in such forward -- looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected. mining exploration and development is an inherently risky business. in addition, factors that could cause actual events to differ materially from the forward-looking information stated herein include any factors which affect decisions to pursue mineral exploration on the relevant property and the ultimate exercise of option rights, which may include changes in market conditions, changes in metal prices, general economic and political conditions, environmental risks, and community and non-governmental actions. such factors will also affect whether trident will ultimately receive the benefits anticipated pursuant to relevant agreements. this list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of the forward -- looking statements. these and other factors should be considered carefully and readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information. third party information as a royalty and streaming company, trident often has limited, if any, access to non-public scientific and technical information in respect of the properties underlying its portfolio of royalties and investments, or such information is subject to confidentiality provisions. as such, in preparing this announcement, the company has relied upon information provided by or the public disclosures of the owners and operators of the properties underlying its portfolio of royalties, as available at the date of this announcement. this information is provided by rns, the news service of the london stock exchange. rns is approved by the financial conduct authority to act as a primary information provider in the united kingdom. terms and conditions relating to the use and distribution of this information may apply. for further information, please contact  or visit  rns may use your ip address to confirm compliance with the terms and conditions, to analyse how you engage with the information contained in this communication, and to share such analysis on an anonymised basis with others as part of our commercial services. for further information about how rns and the london stock exchange use the personal data you provide us, please see our privacy policy. end mscfffsisaiafil (end) dow jones newswires april 30, 2021 02:00 et (06:00 gmt)

super soco’s cpx ‘super-scooter’: going electric for a germ-free commute. sales of electric motorcycles are big news for the bike industry; latest figures show that march registrations in this sector this year are up by 151 per cent over the same month in 2020, while nearly half of all new low-powered scooters are now battery powered. could it be because commuters, post-covid, are fearful of rubbing shoulders with strangers on public transport, because it’s easier to filter past  caused by the spread of ‘emergency’ ltns, or because they’re fun, relatively inexpensive to run and  friendly? it’s probably a mix of all three, but to find what all the fuss is about, i jumped on one of the latest new machines, the cpx ‘super-scooter’ from super soco, who claim it’s similar in performance to a 125cc two-wheeler. attractively styled, the cpx comes either with one battery, offering a claimed range of 44 miles, or two, offering a claimed range of 87 miles. the price difference between the two is significant, with the single-battery model costing £3,599 (after taking the office for zero emission vehicles grant into consideration) and the dual-battery model costing £4,699, demonstrating just how pricey battery technology still is. the cpx comes in black, grey or silver, and is backed by a two-year warranty for the vehicle, three for the battery. it can be ridden on an a1 licence (requiring training, after which, if you pass the various test levels, you will be entitled to carry a pillion and ride on the motorway, although i wouldn’t recommend that on the cpx with its limited top speed). the super soco is reasonably well equipped, with a smart, clear lcd display, reasonably good build quality, a big, comfy (thought slightly too high) squashy seat, a tall, clear, protective screen, very decent rear-view mirrors, a useful parcel rack, a side stand as well as centre stand, and even a reverse mode (useful, perhaps, for getting out of tight front-garden parking spaces). it is - of course - eerily quiet once you turn the key, and all it requires to get moving (there’s no clutch or gears) is a twist of the throttle, which sees the bike spring to life and surge forward thanks to its  (5hp) hub-mounted electric motor. in london traffic it kept up nicely with other vehicles from a standing start; in fact its forte is leaping smartly away from traffic lights. acceleration is reasonably swift and progressive (at least when the batteries are well-charged; during our brief assessment they didn’t drop below 80 per cent), right up to the claimed top speed of around 55mph. the brakes (both operated by hand controls as with a bicycle) worked firmly and effectively, and the steering was sufficiently ‘quick’ to make filtering around other traffic very efficient indeed. it also felt grippy on the road in bends, despite having fairly narrow tyres, although we didn’t ride it in the wet. compared to the more basic model launched by super soco and reviewed here in 2017, the cpx is far more advanced. thanks to the 16-inch front wheel the cpx felt stable and well able to cope with lumps and bumps in the road - at least at the front end. at the rear, where there’s a smaller 14-inch rear wheel, the cpx’s ability to soak up bumps was more limited; you need to slow down for sharper-edged ramps to avoid a jolt through the seat. the cpx was very easy to push into and out of parking spaces (important in london), stable when parked on its side-stand and easy to hoist onto its equally-stable centre stand. despite its rakish looks there’s not much in the way of luxury - it’s a scooter after all - but there’s a small hidey-hole (large enough for a phone though i wouldn’t advise it, it might bounce out) in the leg shields, next to a hook (useful perhaps for carrying take-aways or small shopping bags). there’s also a usb socket for charging purposes, a built-in alarm, decent-sized pillion foot pegs and an ‘ignition’ operated steering lock. the batteries live under the hinged seat and can be charged from a standard household plug in situ, or easily detached and carried indoors to be plugged in. they are heavy, mind, at nearly 20kgs each. you wouldn’t want to carry them far. likes? the cpx is a cinch to ride, very quiet, and (unless you count the fumes going up the electric power station chimney) very ‘clean’. it’s also stable and (vicious speed bumps aside) comfy. dislikes? the otherwise effective screen felt perilously close to my face; i’d prefer it to have been angled further away, for safety. the seat is high and broad on account of the size of the batteries, so will put shorter riders off. i would also have preferred more built-in stowage, but there really isn’t room. if it was mine, i’d invest in a small top box, fitted to the rack. so who’s going to buy it? you could find a new petrol-powered scooter for less but that, of course, would cause more pollution and wouldn’t give you the same, electric, environmental feel-good factor while  through london. it will appeal to those who like the easy, unintimidating, approachable nature of an electric scooter, and to those for whom environmental issues are paramount. crucially it is also - according to figures supplied by super soco - considerably cheaper to run than a petrol model. it’s worth noting, however, that according to motorcycle ‘bible’ mcn, which conducted extensive tests, performance on the cpx can drop off as the batteries’ charge level goes down. they also said they were able to achieve an 80-mile range with two batteries; but only by remaining under 30mph; no problem in london. super soco’s own sums show that an average 125cc petrol scooter costs 5p per mile to run, compared to just 1p for the cpx. over a year, for a typical 23-mile, round commute, over 256 working days a year, that amounts to a cost of £ for a petrol scooter, or a winning £ for the cpx. there’s the added convenience of not having to stop at petrol stations. charging the batteries, instead, they say, takes 3-4 hours and can be done at home or the office. a petrol scooter costs £25 a year to tax, while the keeper of an electric scooter pays nothing. maintenance is also far less of an issue for electric bikes, as there are fewer moving parts. if the cpx’s battery should ever need replacing outside warranty, however, it’s hardly cheap, at over £1,800. so there you have it - a clean, quiet, guilt-free new-tech solution to commuting around london post-covid, while avoiding all those potentially germy commuters on the bus and tube. more information at

asian shares slip on pandemic worries despite wall st rally. by yuri kageyama, ap business writer tokyo (ap) — asian shares were mostly lower friday amid uncertainty about the prospects for a global economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. japan's benchmark nikkei 225 dipped 0.7% in afternoon trading to 28, south korea's kospi slipped 0.9% to 3, australia's s&p/asx 200 fell 0.9% to 7, hong kong's hang seng lost 1.8% to 28,, while the shanghai composite slipped 1.1% to 3, the regional market dips came despite reports of strong economic growth in south korea and a moderation of the unemployment rate in japan, despite a resurgence of the pandemic. major recent outbreaks and slow progress in vaccinations have added to worries about the pandemic in asia, despite some nations such as taiwan, south korea and china faring relatively well in covid-19 related illnesses and deaths. japan remains a poor performer on those fronts, with deaths now topping 10,000 in what experts are calling a fourth wave of infections. tokyo and some other urban areas are under a government-declared state of emergency, but reports say people are still going out and traveling within japan over the golden week holidays that last through next week. “investors will be looking for clues to see if asian corporate earnings will confirm a trend in economic and corporate profit growth or if it is already starting to peak from here,” said anderson alves, a global macro analyst at activtrades. on wall street thursday, stocks overcame a midday stumble to close broadly higher, driving the s&p 500 0.7% higher to another record close. communications companies helped power much of the gain, led by a sharp rise in facebook following the company's latest quarterly report card. banks also helped lead the rally, outweighing a pullback in health care and technology stocks. treasury yields were mixed. investors weighed the latest batch of company earnings reports and encouraging economic data. a report showing that the  economy grew sharply in the first quarter added to data pointing to a recovery from the recession brought on by the pandemic. other upbeat reports included data showing that more americans were signing contracts to buy homes in march after two months of declines. “we’re experiencing a strong economic recovery that’s translating into a strong corporate earnings environment,” said bill northey, senior investment director at  bank wealth management. the s&p 500 index rose  points to 4, the index also hit an all-time high on monday. the dow jones industrial average added 0.7% to 34,, while the nasdaq gained 0.2% to 14, both indexes had slipped earlier in the day. smaller company stocks, which have been outperforming the broader market this year, gave back some of their recent gains. the russell 2000 index lost 0.4%, to 2, the rollout of covid-19 vaccinations, massive support from the  government and the fed, and increasingly positive economic data have been driving expectations for a strong rebound for the economy and robust corporate profit growth this year. that's helped stocks push higher and kept indexes near their all-time highs. still, some of the big risks to the market include rising inflation getting out of hand and any aspect of the virus pandemic worsening and throwing off the economic recovery, said keith buchanan, senior portfolio manager at globalt investments. “without one of those two, the macroeconomic direction seems clear,” he said. so far, company earnings for the first three months of the year are largely exceeding wall street's expectations and stoking bullish profit outlooks for 2021. facebook jumped 7.3% after the social media giant reported stronger-than-expected results for the first quarter thanks to soaring ad revenue.  reported after the close of regular trading that its profit more than tripled in the first quarter. its shares jumped 4.2% in after-hours trading. auto companies fell sharply after ford warned that a worsening global computer chip shortage could cut its production in half during the current quarter. ford fell 9.4% and general motors fell 3.4%. ride-sharing and delivery service companies also dropped following a report that labor secretary marty walsh wants gig workers to be classified as employees. doordash fell 7.6%, uber lost 6% and lyft sank 9.9%. on the economic front, the commerce department said that the  economy grew at a brisk 6.4% annual rate in the last quarter. that acceleration is expected to increase through the summer as more vaccinations are administered and covid-19 cases continue to fall. meanwhile the labor department said the number of americans who filed for unemployment benefits fell again last week. in energy trading, benchmark  crude fell 52 cents to $ a barrel in electronic trading on the new york mercantile exchange. it picked up $ to $ per barrel on thursday. brent crude, the international standard, lost 42 cents to $ a barrel. in currency trading, the  dollar fell to  japanese yen from  yen. the euro fell to $, little changed from $ ap business writers damian j. troise and alex veiga contributed.

implats 3q pgm production slips; backs full-year guidance. by jaime llinares taboada impala platinum holdings ltd. on friday reported that its production of platinum group metals fell in the fiscal third quarter, but reaffirmed full-year guidance. the south african mining company refined 800,000 ounces of 6e platinum group metals--platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, ruthenium and gold--in the three months ended march 31, it said. this was down from 862,000 ounces a year earlier, when the company undertook a material reduction in excess accumulated inventory. conversely, sales volumes increased 14% to 862,000 ounces in the period, the company said. in addition, implats reaffirmed full-year guidance of 3.2 million-3.5 million ounces, with adjusted operating costs of 14,600 rand-15,100 rand ($1,026-$1,061) per 6e ounce, and capital expenditure of zar5.8 billion-zar6.2 billion. chief executive nico muller said implats continues to demonstrate resilience during the pandemic, adding that rand pgm pricing remains elevated. write to jaime llinares taboada at ;  (end) dow jones newswires 04-30-21 0137et

the fortescue (asx:fmg) share price has boosted 13% this month. the fortescue metals group limited  (asx: fmg) share price has been a sensational performer in april among the asx 50 shares. it’s currently the second-highest gainer this month, following only — you guessed it — afterpay ltd (asx: apt) . at the time of writing, fortescue shares are up % in april to $, quadrupling the broader asx 50’s return after a busy month for the mining giant. but there’s a little more to the movements than meets the eye. let’s take a look at the hold-on-to-your-pants month of a fortescue investor.  fortescue’s april highs and lows  the fortescue share price has benefitted from record global iron-ore prices, with rivals bhp group ltd  (asx: bhp) and rio tinto ltd  (asx: rio) also notching up bumper 12 month periods. this month has been no different, and continued hydraulics under the commodity’s value in mid-april once again led to solid gains. fortescue often chews up a few more news bites than its rivals, however, largely due to its ambitious climate targets. it wants to be carbon neutral by 2030, which will encompass a huge reduction from the millions of tonnes of greenhouse gas it currently emits every year. fortescue chair andrew forrest is becoming the spearhead of australia’s business-led fight against climate change, and the company is taking a proactive approach in shifting towards the production of green hydrogen. this month alone, forrest said australia should become “the middle east” of hydrogen production, mere days after his company met with the jordanian government to discuss investment in their hydrogen production facilities. he also called fossil fuels “the most dangerous industry in the world”.  but despite the solid gains, not everything is rosy in term of outlook for the fortescue share price long-term. ubs has called time on the iron-ore boom (admittedly, prices have kept rising since then). moody’s noted that fortescue’s market capitalisation fell by a whopping 17% between february and march alone, and goldman sachs has actively downgraded fortescue to a sell rating, noting its earnings-per-share is well below bhp and rio.  fortescue share price snapshot  it’s also worth noting that the fortescue share price is the only of the big three miners to have a negative return in 2021 so far, still down 4% despite this month’s gains. however, those shares have still increased in value by 88% over the past 12 months. that’s beaten the basic materials sector by 47% and the s&p/asx 200 index (asx: xjo) by 60%.     where to invest $1,000 right now  when investing expert scott phillips has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. after all, the flagship motley fool share advisor newsletter he has run for more than eight years has provided thousands of paying members with stock picks that have doubled, tripled or even more.* scott just revealed what he believes are the five best asx stocks for investors to buy right now. these stocks are trading at dirt-cheap prices and scott thinks they are great buys right now. see the 5 stocks *returns as of february 15th 2021 more reading    not too late to buy these small asx mining shares for the commodities boom   top broker slaps sell rating on fortescue (asx:fmg) share price   asx 200 rises, woolworths falls, fortescue was flat   nrw (asx:nwh) share price rises on fortescue deal   asx 200 up 0.3%: woolworths and fortescue lower on updates, newcrest impresses   motley fool contributor lucas radbourne-pugh has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. the motley fool australia has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. the motley fool has a disclosure policy . this article contains general investment advice only (under afsl 400691). authorised by bruce jackson. the post appeared first on the motley fool australia .

mptf launches $300m fundraising campaign with assist from george clooney, jeffrey katzenberg, yvette nicole brown. the motion picture & television fund is mounting an ambitious fundraising campaign to raise $300 million, plans for which were revealed thursday morning during a virtual event that featured its most prominent supporters including george clooney, jeffrey katzenberg, paramount’s jim gianopulos, jodie foster, yvette nicole brown and tony goldwyn. news of the campaign comes four days after the mptf made history as the first organization to win an oscar when bryan cranston presented a jean hersholt humanitarian award to mptf president and ceo bob beitcher, an honor that coincides with its 100th anniversary and is named for its onetime president. the milestone was mentioned throughout the 60-minute event that also included talk of a memorabilia auction and an upcoming two-night gala produced by bob greenblatt and jennifer todd, created as a way to honor mptf and hollywood history. beitcher kicked off the festivities, signing on virtually from the susan and gary martin screening room inside the louis b. mayer memorial theater on mptf’s woodland hills campus. “we say in our mission statement that we help people live and age well with dignity and purpose,” he explained of the safety net offered by mptf and its social services for entertainment industry professionals. “that’s been true now for 100 years but never more true than in the last 12 months.” beitcher then acknowledged the devastating covid-19 pandemic which claimed the lives of six residents and left thousands of workers in need of services provided by mptf. “mary pickford said, ‘we see a need and we fill it,'” quoted beitcher. “she was never more right than in 2020. we continue to experience higher levels of inbound calls.” katzenberg, an indefatigable champion of mptf who serves on the board of directors and governors, then fielded the call to join the zoom event. “today we celebrate 100 years of great history at the mptf. i think it is an opportunity for us to look to the future. the success of the mptf for the next generation is something that all of us on the board of directors and the board of governors are deeply focused and concerned and excited for. our job is to make sure we pass the baton of the mptf to the next generation in even better shape than we received it from our predecessors.” he called the fundraising drive “essential” and said $200 million will be funneled toward the endowment that will allow “us to ensure that we are well-financed and continue to offer all the great social services” for many years to come. the other $100 million, he noted, will be invested in the physical space. he then passed the baton to beitcher who offered some details about how they plan to use the funds to transform the campus, including continued work on the kirk douglas care pavilion, expansion of living units, a wellness studio, townhouses with full kitchens and laundry appliances, a garden space, a creative center, and a children’s recreation center, among other features. katzenberg returned with a pledge to push for 100 percent participation to achieve the $300 million goal: “what we are looking for, hoping for, wishing for is that every member of the movie and television community over this next year participates. whether you give 100 pennies, 100 nickels, 100 dimes, $100, $100,000, maybe, please $100 million from somebody out there. one hundred percent for our 100th anniversary is how we are going to get there.” paramount chief gianopulos, who serves on the board of directors, delivered the details on the two-night event that will highlight the best of the past while looking to the future and include special performances and appearances. he noted that they are still nailing down the date and venue but that they are eyeing for the fourth quarter of this year: “we could all use an occasion to dress up and celebrate.” another initiative: a historic “auction of the century” that will feature iconic items from hollywood history. foster appeared briefly, in a recorded message, to add, “this 100-year-old mission means that 100 years old is the new sweet 60.” nicole brown, a member of mptf’s next gen board (and “the sunshine of all of this,” per katzenberg), urged industry professionals to join the cause by donating in whatever way they can, either financially or through volunteering their time. “what i love about this mission is that nobody is telling you how much to give, when or where to give. … there are 1,000 ways to give back,” she said. “we have all lived through the ups and downs of this industry. when you’re up, you put a little bit for the person that’s down, and hopefully, if you have your [down] moment, somebody will put a little bit in for you.” she continued: “remember that our time here is limited and this organization is going to go on and on and on. it’s infinite, it keeps going on. let’s all play our part and keep it going.” katzenberg then introduced clooney, who said he was appearing from london where he has been directing his next feature film, the tender bar , starring ben affleck. he joked that for the milestone auction, he was going to talk to warner bros. to see if he could get the suit he wore for his turn as batman, “because, you know, that was really considered one of the great moments in cinema history.” on a more serious note, he said he looks at giving back on behalf of the mptf as a true responsibility. “i look at it as we have this obligation to the people whose shoulders we actually stand on,” he said. speaking of, goldwyn appeared and made mention of his family’s legacy in hollywood, offering up how proud he is to be part of the third generation of goldwyns to have made a living in the entertainment industry. “my grandfather, sam goldwyn, helped start the motion picture relief fund when the industry itself was just in its infancy. and the idea of this unpredictable and often fickle business taking care of its own became a driving passion for my grandpa and my grandmother for their entire lives,” he said, adding how service and giving back trickled down the family tree. “i really look at celebrating this 100th anniversary as a reaffirmation of our moral obligation to take care of our own.”

investigative but intimate: a conversation with robert l. shuster. bonnie jo campbell, who made the final selection in the latest awp award for the novel, singled out robert l. shuster’s to zenzi . the story struck campbell as a “miraculous” combination: “part billy pilgrim, part huckleberry finn, part candide.” that’s great company, and yet entirely congenial, as i found out when the press approached me for a blurb. to zenzi begins as a survivor’s story, with an old man in contemporary new jersey looking back on the berlin of his childhood in spring, 1945. thereafter, amid an inferno of russian assault and nazi madness, the narrative generates skin-prickling suspense over who might get out and how. the boy even seeks shelter in hitler’s bunker, a hive of maniacs. at the same time, however, zenzi cultivates the flowers of first love, and traces adolescent explorations of an artistic calling. altogether the novel’s a breathtaking juggling act, alive with strange colors, far beyond what most first-time novelists can deliver. yet shuster’s isn’t a first novel, exactly. he’s finished two earlier manuscripts, which found agents but not publishers. he’s won fellowships and awards while placing fiction in north american review , in anthologies like yellow silk , and elsewhere. other work includes stints as an art critic at village voice, and cultural criticism in threepenny review . all this background and more came to light as shuster and i began to exchange emails for this rumpus interview. our give and take was entirely electronic, safely distanced, combining email and occasional stints on messenger. throughout, shuster opened up freely as if we sat down over a pair of pints—a powerful reminder of how good fiction always feels familiar, taking us magically from a madman’s bunker to a family tv night. *** the rumpus: few first novels flaunt the rules so freely as to zenzi . the story’s in no way autobiographical, as nearly all of it takes place a long way from your own experience, during the final days of world war ii in berlin. inspiration is always hard to put into words, but what can you say about why you first climbed onto such a wild ride? robert l. shuster: i’ve been fascinated and horrified by the drama of war since about the age of six. as a child in the ‘60s and early ‘70s, i grew up with vietnam on the television every night, described by walter cronkite. but my father was the greater influence; though an ardent pacifist in his youth who’d feared nuclear armageddon, who had argued post-korea with the draft board for conscientious-objector status, he couldn’t get enough of wwii, the war of his boyhood. but he didn’t glorify it. maybe because he feared the endlessness of vietnam, he wanted me and my two younger brothers to see how gruesome war could be. once, he showed me randall jarrell’s poem, “the death of the ball turret gunner,” pointing out the last two chilling lines: “i woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters. / when i died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.” in the summer of 1969, he took the three of us to see two big cinematic spectacles, the battle of britain and, especially riveting, the bridge at remagen . there’s a scene in the bridge at remagen  in which a german teenager, trying to protect his family, is gunned down by an american soldier. the shock of it, among others in the film, was seared into me. a lot of the older war films, too, were shown regularly in my boyhood on television on saturday afternoons, and along with neighborhood friends, we’d reenact everything in backyards. later, as a teenager, looking to books, i devoured remarque’s all quiet on the western front , mailer’s the naked and the dead , and paul fussell’s the great war and modern memory (all influencing to zenzi ). rumpus: that’s a lot of exposure to the war. it’s almost as if this debut were autobiographical after all! but then again, it’s not as if you had firsthand experience in one of the novel’s central settings: the madness in hitler’s bunker. shuster: the bunker was the seed of to zenzi , but it came to me, as story ideas usually do, by happenstance. at the time, i had already written two novels (neither autobiographical); both found agents but not publishers. frustrated by the experience, i thought i’d try my hand at easier-to-sell nonfiction, with a book on the cultural appeal of war. researching it, i somehow ended up reading alan bullock’s one-thousand-page tome, hitler and stalin . at the end, bullock examines the insanity of the führerbunker. i had always imagined it as a small, cramped enclosure, with hitler cowering inside, but not so: the place was a vast labyrinth, complete with meeting rooms, storerooms, a large kitchen, a surgical ward, a dental facility, and so on—and at the end, it was a buzzing hive of desperation, delusion, and considerable debauchery. a perfect setting, it suddenly seemed, for fiction. rumpus: you know, over in berlin, some of the space the bunker occupied remains undeveloped scrub land, even in the heart of the city. the complex was such a vast honeycomb, sections of it still can’t be safely built over. shuster: that’s probably as it should be—a permanent reminder of what happened down there, a tyrant and his henchmen hiding in relative comfort beneath a ruined, massacred world that they continued to destroy. but that megalomania presented a problem for me. i did not want to write from the perspective of a dedicated nazi. then i read about the ceremony held outside the bunker on april 20, 1945, for hitler’s fifty-sixth birthday, in which the fuhrer presented nineteen boys with the iron cross. there was my answer: a boy, who would be, in the novel, the uncounted twentieth. but—to further separate the character from die-hard beliefs—a boy who was there by accident. and further—a dreamy boy who loved to draw spaceships (just as i did at tobias’s age, which gets back to your reference to autobiography: there’s a touch of it here and there). so, i put my nonfiction idea on the back burner (where it still simmers) and started on the novel. rumpus: this leads to a natural follow up, still about research. your novel achieves far greater intimacy than a history like the last battle . what can you say about that source, closer to the bone? shuster: there’s an earnestness to my narrator, eighty-four-year-old tobias koertig, as he describes events in 1945 berlin, and i wanted to capture that feeling not only in his tone and style, but also with a high degree of verisimilitude. i wanted everything he experiences, even the most bizarre, to be plausible, which meant doing a lot of research. bullock’s bibliography led to other books and bibliographies, and soon i was poring over everything i could find, in print and long out of print: histories, memoirs, diaries, old maps, photographic records, and even technical booklets with details on things like berlin’s ubahn, the zoo’s flak towers, and uniforms of the time (the full list is on my website ). watching footage of the war was also important, not just for accuracy, but for getting the mood of the time. i went back to another significant event of my childhood, from 1973, when my entire family watched the twenty-six-week broadcast on pbs of the world at war , certainly one of the best documentaries ever made about wwii. going through it on dvds, i was once again transfixed by everything: the opening heavy-hearted theme; the clipped, melancholy narration of laurence olivier; and above all, the captivating scenes of battle and suffering. for images of ruins (in berlin and elsewhere), two films made right after the war were very useful, too: the search (with montgomery clift)and rossellini’s bleak germany year zero —both of them, as it happens, about children. i plucked bits and pieces from all these sources and tried hard not to make that historical-novel mistake—showing off all you’ve learned. my arbitrary rule is to know ten times more than you’ll ever include. that way, you can be more confident of your portrait. certain books, of course, became primary sources, such as the one you’ve mentioned, ryan’s last battle , and james p. o’donnell’s the bunker , helmut altner’s berlin dance of death , and marie vassiltchikov’s berlin diaries . let me confess that i’ve never visited berlin. i strongly considered going there for more research, but the city in the spring of 1945 was a pile of rubble, and i decided that seeing how it looks today would not help, and might hinder, my imagination of the hellscape. rumpus: well, then, let’s talk about imagination. as a story, to zenzi delivers a lot of skullduggery, the vicious tug-o’-war between factions in the bunker. this shadow-struggle, grasping at the dregs of the reich, provides one of the drivers for tobias’s coming of age. what can you say about combining those two elements? shuster: for tobias, a naive thirteen-year-old dreamer, all the difficulties of adolescence—establishing an identity, dealing with emotions, craving and resisting adulthood—are magnified not only by the war’s terrors, but also by the scheming and deceit of those, like martin bormann, who will do anything to survive. bormann, who was a constant presence in the bunker, looms large for tobias, taking advantage of the boy whenever he can. but the gradual breakdown of tobias’s innocence leads him to question his acquiescence to power and then, in moments of extreme crisis, to commit acts of defiance and violence. that’s not exactly uncommon behavior for a teenaged boy in troubled circumstances, but here, in a world gone mad, it’s a matter of living or dying. rumpus: such a desperate landscape, of course, features desperate people. yet some go bad, like martin bormann, more malicious than hitler himself, while some try for better, like young zenzi; she and tobias could be said to save each other’s lives. can you talk about developing such divergent characters, and setting them in opposition? shuster: the setting of berlin in the spring of 1945 provides a full range of extreme behavior and extreme characters. but i didn’t want cartoonish evil or pure righteousness. it was important, i felt, to keep everyone believably human. hitler speaking fondly of his dog, bormann fiddling with his wedding ring, axmann joking around with his prosthetic arm—these are lighter, even comic, details that make their acts and attitudes all the more monstrous. likewise, a commonplace tension between a teenaged boy and girl strikes an ironic and poignant contrast with the dire situation of a ruined city. tobias, trying to be dutiful in the bomb shelter, is embarrassed by the attentions of assertive, know-it-all, poetry-loving zenzi, but also by his own lust. as their love develops, and their conversations deepen—about the fate of the jews, about fleeing berlin, about their own futures—awkwardness and friction still get in the way. zenzi is irritated by tobias’s boyish concerns and impatient with his sexual timidity. tobias bristles at her condescension, particularly her unhelpful contempt for russian culture when they come under the enemy’s occupation. it took a lot of work, especially in dialogue, to find the right balance between relating their foibles and conveying (without overdoing it) their sense of doom. rumpus: doom lurks everywhere, no question, and yet from the first pages we know that tobias, at least, has survived. hope for more of the same, for small triumphs over the carnage at least, suffuses the text. can you talk about sustaining that tension? earlier you spoke of how you used humor, for instance, and now i’m following up, asking about how a scary story sustains hints of a way out. i realize that details of your plot are off-limits, but perhaps you can come up with analogies, either out of experience or from your reading? shuster: hope rises and falls in the novel like the theme of wagner’s overture to tristan and isolde , up and down, tension building then relieved, with an overall movement to greater and greater volume as the danger increases. the opera, in fact, gets mentioned in the story near the end, but that analogy of form has just occurred to me—which maybe points to the behind-the-scenes work of the subconscious in writing a novel. in any case, some of the hope—glimpses of the way out—comes from history. a lot of people, good and bad, did manage to escape berlin and the russians in the final month of the war, following path-clearing efforts by general wenck’s twelfth army to reach and surrender to the americans, who had been ordered to stop their advance at the elbe river, some sixty miles west of berlin. there’s some heartbreaking footage i found of refugees crossing the elbe over a destroyed bridge—a bit of which i used at the end of to zenzi ’s video preview . the hope of taking that route comes up a few times in the novel, first for zenzi’s father, who studies his maps, and later for zenzi and tobias. and in a story so weighed down by doom, you must give the characters (and the reader) moments of relief—of that melodic lift. several scenes push things into the absurd, making for black humor or sometimes leading to a surprising humanity. and hope for survival is also buoyed by instances of fleeting joy from small things: an unexpected meal, an adolescent kiss, boyish antics, the smell of springtime. rumpus: the novel opens as a letter from a survivor, and that later perspective pops up occasionally thereafter, and then towards the end—we can say this much—the twenty-first century takes over. in short, this novel depends on a frame tale: the story of the story, how it came to be written, and what readers it found. what can you say about this element? again, since we don’t want to give away the plot, perhaps you could find comparative cases. shuster: the novel’s afterword, which comprises the longest modern-day section, came from that wish for versimilitude, for an “outsider’s” stamp of “authenticity.” you get this in nabokov’s lolita , with the foreword by the fictional john ray, jr., , and in arthur golden’s memoirs of a geisha , with its translator’s note by a fictional translator. another example, which became something of a model for me, was thomas berger’s little big man , in which 111-year-old jack crabb’s adventurous story of the old west is discovered (and given “credibility”) by a man of letters, ralph fielding snell. originally, to zenzi had a lengthy foreword, footnotes, and an epilogue, and it actually fooled a couple of early readers (an agent’s assistants) into believing that tobias’s account was real. but those extras ended up being too much, getting in the way of the story. in the end, i jettisoned all but the last piece (now the afterword). there, my fictional historian, christopher voss, “proves” the truth of tobias’s story, but also continues it, shifting to an outsider’s viewpoint, and lending a kind of documentary style—investigative but intimate—to the final scenes. *** photograph of robert l. shuster by leslie kahan photography.

the everything bubble and what it means for your money. authored by colin lloyd via the american institute for economic research, in the aftermath of the black plague which swept across europe between 1347 and 1353, wiping out between 30 and 60% of the population, the european economy changed dramatically.   source: jeremy norman –  the black plague had a lasting socioeconomic impact; for example, towns and cities emptied, and the sudden reduction in the labour force saw wages rise. meanwhile attitudes towards death – and life – changed. the latin phrase,  carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero  – seize the day, place no trust in tomorrow – epitomised this profound shift in attitudes. the current pandemic, whilst utterly tragic, has been far less catastrophic, but due to the policy response it too appears destined to leave its mark in changing patterns of living and working. unlike the 1350’s, however, where the changing price of goods and services signalled imbalances in supply and demand, the valiant monetary and fiscal actions of governments and institutions have distorted this price discovery mechanism.  during the first months of the lockdown, economic growth declined and the price of many equities – and even bonds – fell rapidly. central banks responded, as they had during the great financial crisis (gfc) of 2008/2009, by cutting interest rates, or, where interest rates could be cut no further, by increasing their purchases of government bonds and other high grade securities. as a result of these purchases, major central banks balance sheets have swollen to $29trln: source: yardeni, haver analytics the effect of central bank actions has spilled over into a ballooning of global money supply: – source: yardeni, federal reserve governments, cognizant of the limitations of their central banks, also reacted, providing loan guarantees, supporting the furloughing of employees and sending direct payments to the rising ranks of the unemployed. the chart below, which is from july 2020 and therefore does not account for the recent us $ spending package, nor the $2trln infrastructure proposal, shows the scale of these endeavours in comparison to the fiscal largesse of the gfc: – source: mckinsey  the impact of lower interest rates, buying of bonds and increased fiscal spending might be expected to have inflationary consequences but it has been leaning against the headwind of sharply rising global unemployment: – source: world bank the rise in unemployment was itself a response to a dramatic decline in economic growth: – source: yardeni us unemployment data is beginning to improve but, as the  imf weo april 2021  reveals, europe may take much longer to respond. euro area unemployment is expected to rise from 7.9% in 2020 to 8.3% in 2022. forecasting unemployment, however, together with many other economic variables, has become much more challenging since the variance between estimates has expanded: – source: federal reserve savings surge a natural side effect of rising unemployment, furloughing of staff, together with reduced mobility and economic activity, during the waves of pandemic lockdowns, has been a rise in household savings : – source: s&p global, ons, eurostat, federal reserve the initial recipients of this spring tide of excess savings were the banks: – source: federal reserve, bea, eurostat, japan cabinet office, statistics canada oxford economics estimates that us savings rose $, eurozone households added euro470bln and those of the uk, £170bln. estimates from moody’s put the figure even higher, suggesting that the global pool of excess savings may now have reached $ – roughly 6% of global gdp. since we are only interested in the impact of ‘excess savings’ rather than ‘all savings,’ the next chart is informative. it shows the monthly change in us savings: – source: federal reserve, bea what will be done with these pools of saving? they may remain in bank accounts, be used to pay down debt, spent on goods and services or invested. in a recent article –  what is behind the global jump in personal saving during the pandemic?  the federal reserve reveals the impact during q1-q3 last year: – source: federal reserve, bea, eurostat, japanese cabinet office, statistics canada debt binge the next chart shows global debt and the debt to gdp ratio: – source: iif, bis, imf, national sources such estimates probably underestimate financial sector debt and do not account for otc derivatives, which, according to the bank for international settlements have a net value of $609trln. setting aside derivatives, here is a breakdown by debt type for a selection of larger countries: – source: iif, deutsche bank, visual capitalist during 2020, relative to gdp, government debt rose from 89% to 105%, and financial sector debt to a more moderate 81%. meanwhile, non-financial private sector debt swelled to 165% and non-financial corporate debt to 100%, helped by debt moratoria and loan guarantee programs. many large firms, particularly in the  and japan, increased borrowing simply to bolster their cash holdings. despite rising savings, household debt even managed to increase, from 61% to 65% of gdp, encouraged by cheap mortgages and the resilience of residential real estate: – source: the economist, oecd, land registry, s&p corelogic elected government officials will be afraid to stem these price rises, as they hope that homeowners will feel wealthier which should feed through, eventually, to consumption. a belated exception is new zealand, which extended its ‘bright-line test’ to reign in price increases which hit 23% annualised in march. this smacks of window dressing, as increasing the time an investment property must be held in order to gain tax breaks, from 5 years to 10, is hardly aggressive. meanwhile, to avoid political censure, they have also introduced incentives for first-time buyers, desperate to get on the first rung of the property ladder. the uk government response to rising residential property prices has been more predictable, allowing the maximum loan to value to rise to 95%, creating an even more leveraged residential market.  of course the price of housing also responds to changes in supply. this is the picture in the us, where, despite feverish building activity, the supply of existing homes remains severely constrained: – source: goldman sachs, nar, iii capital management the purchasers of this dwindling supply of residential real estate look increasingly like the ‘haves’ rather than ‘have nots’ – 14% of all us mortgage applications made in february were for second homes, compared to just 7% in april 2020. similar patterns are evident in other countries. little wonder, then, that household debt has risen. if household savings are not being used to pay down debt, that leaves three choices; continued saving (in other words lending to the banks at near zero interest), consumption or investment. the rising price of stocks and resilience of bonds suggests savings are flowing into liquid asset markets: – source: cnbc, boa, epfr global bond markets are more difficult to gauge, as they are not the retail investors’ first port of call. however, central banks continue to expand their balance sheets and the majority of the assets they purchase remain government and agency bonds. meanwhile, many institutions are required to maintain liquidity in their portfolios, making them reluctant buyers of fixed income securities despite negligible or negative real yields.  other assets have also increased in price, including an array of commodities and cryptocurrencies. some of this price appreciation is due to supply constraints but in many instances demand is driving prices higher. this may be because investors fear that the combination of fiscal and monetary expansion, combined with supply chain constraints and trade tensions, will awaken the slumbering giant  inflation . this picture must be tempered, for as money supply has expanded dramatically, its velocity has continued to decline. the chart below shows us m2 but similar patterns are evident in other developed markets: – source: federal reserve the us treasury bond market, led by the eponymous  bond vigilantes , took flight in february and march: – source: trading economics the bond market regained composure thanks to the palliative tone of the federal reserve, elegantly expressed in a recent speech by  governor lael brainard – remaining patient as the outlook brightens   (emphasis mine): – …the emphasis on  outcomes rather than the outlook  corresponds to the shift in our monetary policy approach that suggests policy should be patient rather than preemptive at this stage in the recovery. many developed market government bonds remain close to the zero bound, yet yields have risen from their nadir at the end of 2020. as of 2nd march a mere 17% of sovereign issuance enticed investors with a negative yield to maturity: – source: lpl research, bloomberg the  quest for yield , which has driven investors into riskier assets for more than a decade, continues to provide an alternative to low or negative-yielding government paper. the dark blue line on the chart below shows the narrowing of the credit spread of bbb corporate bonds even as us 10-year yields rose: – source: amundi, bloomberg this  yield compression  is seen even more starkly in the spread between us 10-year and 30-year us mortgages: – source: federal reserve household wealth considering the constrained nature of the us residential housing market and the fact that the 30-year mortgage to 10-year treasury spread is at its narrowest since july 2011 one can hardly be surprised at the appreciation of residential real estate prices. in fact the inflation of  the everything bubble  means that, unlike previous recent recessions, during the recent pandemic household net worth has actually risen: – source: gavekal, 3 fourteen research  the great reopening looking back over the last year, it is unsurprising that asset markets have risen. as lockdowns end and life returns towards  the new normal , the key question is, what percentage of excess savings and recent investments will be redirected towards consumption and how quickly? the conference board global consumer confidence index hit an all-time high of 108 in q1, 2021, up from 98 the previous quarter – this is the highest reading since the survey began in 2005. confidence rose in 49 out of 65 markets. when the uk reopened retail outlets, after four months, on april 12th, year-on-year footfall surged +516%, but it was still down -15.9% on the equivalent day in 2019. according to a mintel survey, 34% of uk consumers still feel unsafe visiting stores. full lockdown restrictions in the uk will not end until june 21st. the road to reopening will be gradual. the us morning consult consumer confidence index reveals a similar picture: – source: morning consult morning consult indices of 15 other economies show the same pattern, yet in each case a larger share of lower income households reported a deterioration in their financial position over the past year. goldman sachs estimates that nearly two-thirds of excess savings in the us are held by the richest 40%, and they predict that the majority of these savings will be saved rather than spent. as of q3, 2020 the top 20% of households by wealth held $ in liquid assets, the next 20% owned $, whilst the balances of the remaining 60% amounted to just $ as of end q4, 2020 the top 20% garnered an additional $ of savings, and the remaining 80% accumulated just $  this breakdown between richer and poorer households is important. a recent federal reserve study revealed that, under normal circumstances, households in the bottom quintile spend $ of every dollar earned, while those in the top quintile spend just $ a february bank of america survey, asking more than 3,000 people how they would use another stimulus check, reveals a similar result – only 36% said they would spend the money. if only $570bln out of $ of excess savings has been invested in stocks so far this year, there would appear to be a powerful put option under the stock market, but is this the correct conclusion? without consumption spending, corporate profits will disappoint. without consumption, demand-pull inflation will melt away, leaving only supply-chain bottlenecks to prop up inflation forecasts. unemployment is still elevated, union membership continues to decline and new private capital expenditure will arrive cautiously. the bond vigilantes may have come to their  inflationary  senses, for government bond yields have already started to decline. lower bond yields, however, will support the stock market, as they have done for the last decade, and so too will excess savings. add in cheap finance and  the everything bubble  looks set to continue. the melt-up from here will be gradual and there is room for some sharp corrections as the base effect of last year’s disinflation spooks the  inflation bears.  as for what is really happening?  the everything bubble  is a grand illusion, money is growing more plentiful, credit more available. asset prices are not really rising; it is the value of money which is being systematically undermined. i wonder whether the motto for this pandemic will be  carpe diem, quam minimum credula pecunia  – seize the day, place no trust in money?

"how big banks have been allowed to manipulate the market forever by law enforcement failures part 2 (morgan stanley and finra). hello everybody, today i am continuing where i left off on my [last dd](_big_banks_have_been_allowed_to_manipulate_the/) talking about how the big banks have been allowed to manipulated the market for a long time.
lets first talk about morgan stanley, since we didn't at all in the last dd.
[wait...](.jpg?width=1025&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3d77fd4fff61f193a5cb686427464b622904587)
you're telling me... that big banks like morgan stanley are allowed to legally commit naked shorting on their own investments to try and boost the stock? after i thought they were made illegal after the 2008 financial crisis... so morgan stanley nakedly shorted uber's stock right before going they went onto the market to try and give a boost.
[coincidence](.jpg?width=992&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3232487ec5c4321bfccf8c1cdbe110d02248711)
ohhh.... so you mean that it just happens that this tactic just so happens to have the same name as the practice outlawed after the 2008 crash? seriously? so if the rich ever seem about to lose money, just do some naked shorting and get it all back, with full permission. [sour](-underwriters-worried-about-the-ipo-deployed-unusual-naked-)[ce for above screnshots](-underwriters-worried-about-the-ipo-deployed-unusual-naked-)

luckily this time, when morgan tried to naked short uber, their plan failed. as we all know however, once doesn't make a difference if they do it all the time.

ah, so this technique doesn't even help everyone, only the people shorting in the first place. of course, why would morgan stanley do it for any other reason? [source for above screenshots](-morgan-stanley-s-nuclear-option-failed-uber-stock-plunged)
while naked shorting in interesting and all, there is more than just that.

well well well, seems like justice- wait... they were only fined $10 million, despite being worth billions? well, that's actually a pretty big fine compared to what the government usual give-

yup... just the like dtcc, finra, the watchdog for wall street, is owned by wall street. private and self-regulation. of course they can fine even more than the government does, it doesn't even make up a fraction of their earnings, and it makes them look better than the government.
[same old same old](.jpg?width=1122&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5595eb752635dbd33611130d4bcec9d89e5d315)
and of course, the same excuse. it was an accident, human error, machine error, anything except actually accepting blame. and as per usual, the excuse is accepted. why wouldn't it? the law enforcement this time is literally a private cooperation funded by those it is supposed to regulate.
[really?](.jpg?width=1116&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae2e53e644b597f2e35887818ac00608237ce3b5)
so it was a mistake, despite the fact that they knew the mistake was there and didn't fix it for two years? okay, someone still not their fault though, right? [source](-morgan-stanley-fine/morgan-stanley-unit-to-pay-10-million-fine-for-anti-money-laundering-violations-iduskcn1op0yl)
we could go on and on about morgan, so let's look into finra some more.
[what it is](.jpg?width=963&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5a8f9aff094bb4ee4fc103bca1ec728a3aca37e)
basically, it's a non-governmental organization which writes and enforces rules for brokers and broker-dealer firms in the
[i know](.jpg?width=964&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c960cfd873402565833365840fbbe66a37d25a0)
their biggest criticism ""is that they do just enough to maintain the public's trust."" like i said earlier, fining morgan stanley $10 million is cool, but they could've done so much more.
[rinse and repeat](.jpg?width=950&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6da907e34dc4f2ab85cb4ad95d58986339a5e028)
and of course, they let the people get away with their crimes just so they can do some more. it seems to be a pattern.
[obviously](.jpg?width=991&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60364936b27e49fd2f05a8d71059314306f5c858)
the most obvious issue of them all, conflict of interest, obviously the worst need to go in order to maintain the illusion of regulation, but the people on top will never allow themselves to be caught. [source for above screenshots](.asp)
and that's all for today. always somehow, someway, these market manipulators escape justice. they make their own justice. we need to bring them back to our system. hopefully that's what gamestop does, but no one knows for sure what will happen.

guarantee who you are going to see doing it. let’s get to it. here are last week’s results if you need a recap. opening sequence. mansoor vs. akira tozawa tozawa takes him down into a chinlock and then switches over to a headlock. that’s reversed into a cradle so they get back up and run the ropes, with mansoor dropping down three times in a row. tozawa eventually trips over him but is right back with a shining wizard for two. the backsplash gets the same and, with both of them sitting, they chop it out. it’s tozawa getting the better of things and grabs a chinlock but mansoor fights back up with a spinebuster. the ddt gives mansoor two so tozawa sends him to the apron, allowing mansoor to come back with the slingshot neckbreaker for the pin at 5:33. rating: c. just another mansoor win here as the winning streak continues as we move towards another saudi arabia show. i’m not sure if it is going to be anything noteworthy in the end but mansoor is having good enough matches against decent opponents. it would be nice if that meant something before they go overseas again, but i would be stunned if we saw that. quick look at roman reigns retaining at wrestlemania. from smackdown. here is roman reigns, flanked by jey uso and paul heyman. after looking around for a bit, reigns has heyman explain the kind of competition he had to face. heyman explains who daniel bryan and edge are, allowing reigns to talk about how no one is on his level. he has done everything he was asked to do and stacked up the competition to pin them both at once. with that out of the way, cut the check and fire up the jet. reigns goes to leave but here’s cesaro to interrupt, which gets reigns’ attention. he leaves anyway as cesaro stares him all the way to wrestlemania: backlash . from smackdown. cesaro vs. jey uso uso sends him into the ropes to start but cesaro gets in a quick slam to take over. cesaro takes him to the apron and goes after cesaro’s hand but gets knocked to the floor. the dive off of the apron drops uso and we take a break. we come back with uso work working on the arm to try and keep cesaro down. uso goes up but gets caught with a dropkick. a gutwrench superplex gives cesaro two and he cartwheels out of an armdrag. cesaro nails a springboard uppercut and mcafee is rather impressed. uso is back with a pop up neckbreaker for two but cesaro nails a discus lariat. the swing goes on but here is seth rollins to jump cesaro for the dq at 11:10. rating: c+. good enough while it lasted but they telegraphed the ending the entire night with the ufo clip. that isn’t a terrible thing, but it also didn’t give us the most drama. cesaro is looking primed for a one off shot against reigns, but it also might be better to have him beat rollins again first. reigns isn’t going to lose to cesaro, so building him up a bit more first is a good way to make wrestlemania not seem like a fluke. post match rollins lays him out and shouts that cesaro got lucky. the sooner cesaro figures that out, the better it is for him. quick look at drew mcintyre winning a triple threat to become the new #1 contender to bobby lashley but getting laid out by mace and t-bar. from raw. here is drew mcintyre to get things going. we get a recap of him winning a triple threat match last week to become #1 contender to bobby lashley. after the win, he was attacked by mace and t-bar, with mvp looking on in approval. with the recap of last week out of the way, mcintyre recaps last week. mcintyre gets to mace and t-bar, but he doesn’t believe that they are the masterminds here. that would be mvp, which has mcintyre wondering if mace and t-bar are going to start wearing those nice suits. cue mvp, who implies he didn’t know anything about it, causing drew to mock him for suggesting he didn’t know anything about it. mvp says lashley is expecting mcintyre to be a worthy challenger at wrestlemania backlash. as for mace and t-bar, lashley recently decided to downsize the hurt business, so why would he need those two after he already beat mcintyre at wrestlemania? mace and t-bar have zero affiliation with the hurt business. mcintyre doesn’t seem to buy it but here are mace and t-bar to jump him again. the double sitout chokeslam drops mcintyre and the two walk past mvp, who doesn’t really respond. from raw. drew mcintyre vs. mace/t-bar no partner for mcintyre, who charges at t-bar and hammers away to start. a kick to the face sets up a battle over a suplex with mcintyre pulling it off for two. mvp is watching in the back as mace comes in to unload on mcintyre in the corner. some running knees put mcintyre down and we hit the chinlock….and go to a wide shot to show off the thunderdome for some reason (ala vince mcmahon in the mid 90s pay per views). mace suplexes him for two but mcintyre hits t-bar with a spinebuster for two. the glasgow kiss slows t-bar down but mace’s distraction lets the double teaming begin. the referee throws it out at 5:57. rating: c-. this didn’t have time to go very far but at least mace and t-bar didn’t get pinned right out of the box. it isn’t a win, but they lost because they were beating mcintyre up instead of a result of the opposite. i’m still curious about where this goes, though i have next to no confidence in it going anywhere positive for them in the long term. immediately after the bell, here’s braun strowman to clear off not retribution. load up the tag match. braun strowman/drew mcintyre vs. t-bar/mace yeah you knew it was coming as soon as the music hit. strowman powers out of a headlock to start and then runs mace over with a shoulder. drew certainly likes that and braun forearms mace down. t-bar comes in and is pounded down into the corner as well. a mace distraction lets t-bar get in a chop block though and we hit the reverse chinlock. t-bar knees him in the back and grabs another chinlock but strowman backdrops his way to freedom. the hot tag brings in mcintyre to pick up the pace, including an overhead belly to belly to mace. there’s a jumping neckbreaker into mcintyre’s nip up….and there goes mace’s mask. commentary doesn’t seem to recognize him as a former member of their family, even as mcintyre hits him with the mask for the dq at 5:24. rating: c-. just a tag match here but losing the mask might get rid of a little bit of the retribution stigma. again, this is better than the team getting pinned, though it still isn’t exactly the best way to make them seem like big stars either. they went with another tag formula match here and that was fine, though it would be nice to see mace and t-bar pin someone. like, ever. post match strowman rips off t-bar’s mask and knocks him outside as well. the start of non retribution’s theme sounds like neville’s nxt music. stills of bianca belair winning the smackdown women’s title at wrestlemania. from smackdown. here are the street profits to take part in bianca belair’s championship celebration. back from a break with the profits talking about how wrestlemania was a night to remember but there was one match that stood out about the others. we get a video on belair beating sasha banks to win the smackdown women’s title, including the media attention that followed. montez ford talks about how special that was and brings out belair to for the big presentation as champion. belair takes her time soaking in a loud est chant and says she can’t believe she got here. if you told her she would be here with this title….well she probably would have said yes, because that is who she is. you should never apologize for being the b-e-s-t because if you can dream it, you can do it. then there is sasha banks, who pushed her like no one ever has and both of them made history. they both did, but belair is the champ. the title is for everyone who believed in her and they are just getting started creating history. they all hug but belair tells ford to get back to business, because it’s time to get some more gold. lince dorado vs. drew gulak gran metalik is here with lince. they go to the mat to start and get nowhere so let’s have a standoff instead. gulak takes him down by the leg and grabs a hammerlock. that’s broken up so gulak takes him down into a chinlock instead. dorado is back up again and snaps off a running hurricanrana so gulak plants him with a side slam. we take a break and come back with commentary explaining that there is a wager on the match: if gulak wins, he gets $1000 but if he loses, he has to wash the house party’s laundry. i’m not sure if i should be more amazed by there being an actual angle or by commentary forgetting to mention that until a few minutes into the match. anyway, gulak hits a sitout powerbomb for two and we’re back in the chinlock. dorado fights up and gets two off a backslide, followed by a lionsault press for two more. there’s a faceplant for the third two in a row but gulak electric chair faceplants him into something like an stf. with that broken up, dorado hits a superkick into the shooting star press for the pin at 10:46. rating: c+. good stuff here, which shouldn’t be surprising. ignoring the match though, while it was a low level idea, just having something on this match made it feel more important. i can’t imagine this took more than ten seconds to put together and if they throw in a quick vignette or promo to pay it off next week, great. i can’t imagine it is that hard to ask the wrestlers to come up with some idea like this one and it at least made the match feel a tiny bit important. no it probably won’t last but i’ll take it. we recap charlotte’s return, followed by her costing asuka a title shot against rhea ripley. from raw. here is charlotte for a chat. she is tired of the lack of respect from the women’s locker room. wrestlemania was taken away from her and that just wasn’t fair. she can beat asuka and rhea ripley on the same night, so tonight asuka is getting taken out as ripley sees what charlotte can do. cue asuka and ripley, with the latter being willing to take charlotte up on her offer, even though asuka is beating her tonight. asuka goes to say something but charlotte cuts her off and condescendingly reminds her of the wrestlemania match. asuka promises to beat her tonight, “b****”. i would pay a good bit of money to come up with any new way to present charlotte other than the “i’m better than all of you” heel. and from raw. asuka vs. charlotte rhea ripley comes out to watch as charlotte grabs a headlock. they fall out to the floor in a heap though and it’s off to an early break. back with charlotte hammering away but asuka scores with a knee to the face. a shining wizard (leg kick according to virk, as the completely understandable learning curve continues) drops charlotte but what looked like a codebreaker completely misses. thankfully commentary doesn’t try to hide it as they slug it out from their knees. charlotte is up with a spear for two and then heads to the apron. asuka’s kick to the ribs is blocked and charlotte wrenches on the knee as long as she can. back in and the asuka lock sends charlotte to the ropes so she takes asuka’s bad leg out again. the figure eight goes on but ripley breaks it up, meaning the fight is on. asuka kicks charlotte in the arm and crucifixes her for the pin at 9:16, though charlotte’s shoulder was a bit off the mat. rating: c+. i know charlotte loses here and it seems to set up asuka vs. ripley ii, but come on. you know charlotte is getting in that title match because that is what charlotte does almost every single time. it’s going to happen no matter what and it wouldn’t shock me to see her win the title again. i would certainly hope not, but it isn’t like it would be unprecedented. post match charlotte yells at the referee and beats him down, even continuing as other referees come out to yell at her. overall rating: c+. i liked the original stuff more than usual (because it had a little bonus for the first time in….well years) but the rest of the show just brought up how dull raw has been. the big charlotte features at the end were hard to watch and the only saving grace is that it isn’t mandy rose/dana brooke vs. nia jax. reigns and cesaro could be interesting though and that alone puts smackdown above raw. it’s a bad time in wwe right now, and given that wrestlemania was less than two weeks ago, that should be rather scary.     remember to follow me on twitter  and head over to my amazon author page with 30 different cheap wrestling books at: -hall/e/b00e6282w6 and r emember to

don’t take the p*** out of tony blair’s mullet – he doesn’t look like pat sharp, i fancy him more than ever… it’s sexy. former pm tony blair sported a silvery mullet on telly - and viewers were left in stitches, comparing him to children’s tv presenter pat sharp and late club owner peter stringfellow.  the ex-labour leader, 67, was making a serious point on itv about scottish independence — but online wags were more interested in his hair. 5 blair stunned viewers with his locks  the ex-labour boss, who left office in 2007 and handed over to gordon brown, showed off his long grey do during an interview - leading to one person quipping “it’s not tony blair, it’s tony hair.” another said: “i think pat sharp has some serious competition.” but one woman who was left swooning after spotting the ex-pm’s swishy locks was mum-of-two and writer hannah verdier, 48, from south london.“he looked hot,” she says. now hannah explains exactly why she fancies 'tone'... 5 hannah has confessed how much she fancies blair credit: supplied  as soon as i saw tony blair on itv earlier this week my heart skipped a beat. no, not because of what he was saying (to be honest i wasn’t really paying attention) but because of his hair.  other people might have been taking the p*** out of his silvery grey mullet which resembled pat sharp’s locks, but i was utterly charmed. he looks fantastic, like a man in his prime. cherie - you’ve got a love rival. hair haters are gonna hate, but at 67 the labour legend can still get away with the kind of hairdo harry styles would be proud of.  5 tony during his number 10 heyday credit: times newspapers ltd  his new barnet is a style statement, not the result of shirking a long-awaited visit to the barber’s and it’s one that makes him look hotter than ever. back in the early noughties, tony turned heads when he and his rippling beach bod were named heat magazine’s torso of the week, a prestigious accolade usually reserved for the likes of daniel craig.  but he’d already turned my head. he was the rishi sunak of his day, with hotness and power oozing from every pore.  you knew you were in safe hands with tone, in more ways than one. as a trembling young reporter i once sat next to him on the downing street sofa while i gave him a grilling for a teen magazine and it’s only now that i can finally come out and tell the truth: he was hot - and his greying locks which have been cruelly compared to the late peter stringfellow’s just make him hotter. he looks fantastic, like a man in his prime.  cherie - you’ve got a love rival. hannah verdier 48  tony was always perfectly dressed and in control, he had noel gallagher on speed dial and you just knew that he and cherie weren’t afraid to rumple their john lewis quilt cover.  the fact that andrew scott - who played the hot priest in fleabag -  is lined up to play him in the crown is perfect casting.  strong and sexy, both are men who’d hold your gaze for a second too long. in a good way. if reports and memoirs are to be believed, tony and cherie enjoy a marriage packed with hot lovin’, but if by any chance he was ever on tinder there would be no shortage of right swipes for the silver fox.  his hair is evolving into something that will help him stay sexy into his 70s, a la mick jagger or jeff bridges.  5 people compared blair's locks to the late peter stringfellow's credit:  - getty  technically, it’s not even a mullet because it’s not short on top – it’s just flowing.  and come the summer, he can even rock a headband or man bun. it’s been a lean year for fun and all we’ve had to rely on for eye candy at teatime is government briefings.  would you rather enjoy a heated political debate with matt hancock, who at 42, is 25 years tony’s junior but would never take a risk with his boring follicles?  blair came to power in his 40s and maybe it was the spice girls soundtrack, the joy of euro ‘96 or the air of optimism, but he looked a lot younger and hotter than today’s starched rabble.  you just knew that he and cherie weren’t afraid to rumple their john lewis quilt cover. hannah verdier 48  so it’s only right that he now embraces the grey and lets his hair flow. i bet cherie loves it! this is the hair of a man who still has the ability to surprise his woman after all these years. the kind of hairdo that keeps calm in interviews but then is ready to party the moment it spins around. you don’t need an opinion poll to tell you the bare facts: the more a man pays attention to his style, the hotter he’s going to be in bed.  talking of which, it’s a funny old week when the hair choices of one politician can eclipse another’s attempt to get other people to pay for his new curtains, but here we are. blair has taken the art of the silver fox to the next level. 5 watch out cherie - hannah's in town credit: splash news  live blog raging prince meghan's 'beyond the pale attack on kate middleton was william's final straw' mystic meg april 30: your gift is juggling all the different aspects of yourself hill we go edinburgh couple trek 30km and 40k steps conquering seven hills tiktok challenge long last love i'm 27 & never been kissed or slept with someone - i’ve never come close grubs up scots hotel launch 29-minute breakfast challenge with huge plate of food open minded meet other stars who shun monogamy as willow smith comes out as ‘polyamorous’ meanwhile this line of duty fan confessed she was hot for supt. hastings - admitting she thought he was a 'goer in the sack'. mother of god! and read these hilarious memes about tony blair's hair - we promise you'll giggle.  tony blair admits mistakes over scottish independence while showcasing new hair
rt : i knew so many people that would've bought the beast morphers red and gold zords if they could just find them in stores.
"**shares**
for those who are holding shares, there was only great news today and imho you'd be wise to hold onto those things long term. like i said before i expect it to double in 2-3 years with very little downside risk. worst case scenario for the markets is a covid surprise, which amzn would probably benefit from. people assume they have regulatory risk cuz both parties talk shit about them but if they're broken up they'll just be worth more.
**calls**
coming into earnings my general plan was to hold with a 4%+ bump and sell with anything &lt;2% and of course we got some goldilocks numbers in the middle.
after these numbers, i'd bet amzn hits $4000 by mid june. for that reason i plan to sell my 4000 / june 4 calls as a limit sell around where we're at, $3,553. hopefully they'll pop a bit premarket and i'll sell at the bell.
what my decision comes down to is this - don't forget the original thesis for why i bought the calls. i bought them because i knew a massive earnings day could spark a massive breakdown which would make us massive money. we got great numbers but not massive ones, so i plan to sell while i'm ahead and live to make another big bet.
obviously everyone has different strikes/expirys here so i'm interested in your thoughts. i'd hold $4000 calls for late june exp or later personally.
my next comment will be actual dd."

anne douglas, widow of hollywood legend kirk, passes away at 102. los angeles: anne douglas , a philanthropist and widow of hollywood legend kirk douglas , died thursday at her home in beverly hills, her family said. she was 102. kirk douglas, who died in february 2020 at the age of 103, met his future wife in paris in 1953, while filming 'act of love'. after a whirlwind courtship, the couple got married in las vegas on may 29, 1954. "it wasn't romantic, but it was legal and her new husband vowed that someday he would marry her again in a big celebration," the douglas family said in their statement. kirk douglas, one of the last superstars of hollywood's golden age of cinema renowned for performances in 'spartacus' and 'paths of glory', fulfilled that promise in 2004 for their 50th anniversary. the couple were married for 66 years and had two sons, peter and eric. their family also included two other sons, michael and joel, children from kirk douglas's first marriage. anne douglas was born hannelore marx in hanover, germany on april 23, 1919. she was a student in belgium when the nazis bombed brussels in 1940. anne escaped by car with friends, headed toward france. but her german papers were a liability, and she married a belgian to obtain nationality. months after their arrival in paris, the germans occupied the city. when the nazis decreed that movies must be shown with german subtitles, anne's knowledge of german, english, french and italian enabled her to find work with a french film distributor. afp after a whirlwind courtship, the couple got married in las vegas on may 29, 1954. after the war, she continued her career in the industry, working for american network nbc, then for john huston on the production of "moulin rouge," before meeting kirk. anne douglas was active in diplomacy and philanthropy, including visiting 44 countries as a goodwill ambassador for american values, work for which she was honored by the state department's united states information agency. her philanthropy benefited causes including performing arts, women's cancers research and homeless women. after learning of unsafe playgrounds at los angeles schools, anne was determined to fix them. "she convinced her husband the only way to fund the massive endeavor was to auction most of their art collection at christie's," the family said, adding that the effort had resulted in 403 refurbished play spaces. "i often wonder what would have happened to me if i hadn't married anne," her husband had said. "i might not have survived without her business acumen and her finely-honed instincts."

"keeping precious metals around to try and time the market is foolish, in my view.  if you are interested in building wealth over time (say 10 years+) then these metals will slow you down.
we have had huge financial shocks in the last 20 years but i urge you to go look at some graphs.  you’re better served trusting that people want to buy stuff (investing in equities) than trusting that you can predict the future.
also, if you want to hurt your financial future and reduce your future back pain then try etfs that reflect the value of silver instead.  :)"

covid rates are down but not gone. remember your neighbors (and get a vaccine).. in 4 to 6 minutes without taking a breath, life is over. but most of us don’t give our next breath a second thought. a respiratory virus, however, can change that quickly. as reported on npr, when audrey ellis, a 29-year-old marathon runner with no pre-existing medical conditions, came down with a covid-19 infection, even routine activities taxed her breathing. eventually as complications mounted, she died from heart failure in march, 2020. young, athletic and “at the top of her game,” her life was painfully cut short by a virus that wouldn’t quit. to be sure, thousands of people both young and old have recovered successfully from a covid-19 infection, but over 574,000 of our friends, neighbors and loved ones have not. their deaths are clear reminders that covid-19 can kill. the mourning and loss in those families is heartbreaking. none of us wants to be a part of that kind of suffering and would rather think of ourselves as people who build hope for the future. growing up in the 1960s, we were bombarded by public service ads drawing attention to car accidents causing 50,000 deaths annually. we were told “buckle up america” in media campaign after media campaign. now our population has grown from 194 million in 1965 to almost 334 million today and we have over four times the number of vehicles on the road as we did in the 1960s. yet, the annual car accident death rate is lower, averaging 38,000 lives lost every year. this is in large part due to automatic seat belt use, better highway design and construction, cars with safety features like airbags, and better choices about not driving after using alcohol. these advancements and our adaptive capabilities have combined to help save over 12,000 lives every year. as we write this, it is springtime and people are moving outside and enjoying restaurants, bars and beaches. media reports show people gathering and the infrequent wearing of masks or social distancing. there are some who say personal freedoms should not be restricted by public health mandates; these voices speak from strongly held beliefs about our country, the declaration of independence and  constitution. we believe in these cornerstones of our democracy and both of us have faithfully defended them in our own times of voluntary military service and public service as university professors and health care providers. like the founders of our country, we believe that a key role of government is to protect its citizens from “all enemies, foreign and domestic.” all of us are faced with an enemy now, the novel coronavirus; one that threatens to leave more devastation if we are not cautious and care about one another. audrey ellis lost her valiant fight in the prime of her life from person-to-person spread, and this continues to happen. now is the time to maintain prevention behaviors that will push infection rates down everywhere, for all of us. we know that as many as 50% of covid-19 cases are asymptomatic and can cause unknowing spread to vulnerable family members and friends. loved ones may die as a result of mask-free spring flings when effective public health measures are ignored or poorly enforced. for generations we were taught the golden rule, to treat others as you would like them to treat you. the golden rule hasn’t changed. spring is a beautiful season – one where we have the opportunity to spend time outdoors and demonstrate love of our neighbors by wearing a protective mask when indoors, washing our hands, maintaining social distance, avoiding large crowds, and getting the vaccine. we urge doing the right thing, love your neighbor, and together let’s make a brighter future for everyone.. let us hope that we do not need the loss of a loved one to remind us to care enough to maintain prevention-oriented behavior. charles r. carlson, , abpp, and craig s. miller, ,  are clinical scholars sponsored by the robert wood johnson foundation at the university of kentucky.

gems of  positivity. following the launch of a playful ring in 1990, piaget incorporated spinning elements to other types of jewellery to expand the possession range. ornamental stones have embellished the jewellery designs since 2017 and the new collection twirls with malachite, carnelian and turquoise on rose gold pieces. each stone brings its positive energy and vibrant colour to the designs. malachite radiates with flowing lines in shades of green while carnelian carries a lucky deep red and turquoise is in a protective blue with healing properties. luck pendants can be worn on the stone or the rose gold side with an engraving of a special date or initials offered for personalisation. sliding pendants sparkle with brilliant-cut diamonds while the central ornamental stone can slide up and down. hence, the long necklace can be worn in different ways, with three matching hard stone beads and two gold beads as details to the design. likewise, the versatile earrings can be adapted and worn with gold beads as studs, with the gold and the ornamental stones beads or even asymmetrically.

the global chip shortage is going from bad to worse. here's why you should care. in the market for a new car, smartphone or washing machine this year? a global shortage of computer chips could mean you have to wait a while and pay more. in the market for a new car, smartphone or washing machine this year? a global shortage of computer chips could mean you have to wait a while and pay more. in the market for a new car, smartphone or washing machine this year? a global shortage of computer chips could mean you have to wait a while and pay more. several factors are driving the crunch, which was initially concentrated in the auto industry. the first is the coronavirus pandemic, which plunged the global economy into recession last year, upending supply chains and changing consumer shopping patterns. carmakers cut back orders for chips while tech companies, whose products were boosted by lockdown living, snapped up as many as they could. other shocks, such as us government sanctions on chinese technology companies and extreme weather, have also contributed to the shortage of  computer chips in highest demand are not particularly sophisticated or expensive. but they're indispensable components used in everything from kitchen appliances to washing machines and electronic gadgets. the shortage is going from bad to worse, spreading from cars to consumer electronics. with the bulk of chip production concentrated in a handful of suppliers, analysts warn that the crunch is likely to last through  to goldman sachs, 169 us industries embed semiconductors in their products. the bank is forecasting a 20% average shortfall of computer chips among affected industries, with some of the components used to make chips in short supply until at least this fall and possibly into 2022.  to understand how the chip shortage is hitting the economy, let's start with cars:auto industry hobbledthe average car has between 50 and 150 chips. they're used in a growing number of applications, including driver assistance systems and navigation control. when the pandemic forced carmakers to temporarily shutter factories last year, semiconductor manufacturers reassigned spare production capacity to companies making smartphones, laptops and gaming devices — products in high demand from housebound consumers. then, car sales bounced back faster than expected and automakers responded by ramping up production. but they found themselves at the back of the line for , ford, fiat chrysler and nissan were forced in january to adapt production and, in some cases, idle plants because of the shortages. the problem continues to disrupt the industry. on thursday, bmw-owned mini said it is suspending production at a plant in england for three days due to the availability of semiconductor components. ford warned wednesday that the chip shortage will reduce production this year by some 1.1 million vehicles and cut its profit by about $2.5 billion.  the chip shortage places the production of 1.3 million cars and vans at risk globally in the first quarter, according to research firm ihs  said that a fire last month at a japanese chip factory owned by renesas electronics, as well as ongoing disruption following severe winter weather in texas, will worsen the situation. nxp semiconductors, infineon and samsung were forced to shut factories in austin for a week in february due to a winter storm that disrupted power and water supplies."the week-long closures will be felt for months," ihs said in a recent research note. a big part of the problem: carmakers have limited options when it comes to securing additional  semiconductor manufacturing company, for example, is responsible for producing about 80% of the microcontroller units used in cars, according to a bain & co. report. these parts manage functions such as power windows, braking and headlights. tsmc is pouring $100 billion into advanced chips over the next three years to keep up with rising demand. smartphones and appliancesconsumer electronics manufacturers are also getting slammed by  told analysts on its earnings call thursday that it's working hard to reduce shortages of semiconductors and other key parts, which could weigh on sales of products like smartphones.  in a call with analysts on wednesday, apple chief financial officer luca maestri said that the company expects revenue will be $3 billion to $4 billion lower this quarter thanks to"supply constraints." that includes problems procuring chips, which are expected to affect the production of ipads and macs. the dearth of supply will knock other smartphone makers too."covid-19 is still a major consideration, but it is no longer the main bottleneck," canalys research manager ben stanton said thursday."supply of critical components, such as chipsets, has quickly become a major concern, and will hinder smartphone shipments in the coming quarters," he added. beyond cars and smartphones, computer chips are used in an array of household , which makes washing machines and refrigerators, told cnn business on thursday that it was"doing well so far regarding production constraints and prolonged delivery lead times," but is keeping a close eye on developments. "we continue to put all our efforts in mitigating possible risks from potential component shortages," it  going up?for consumers, the chip shortages could lead to an increase in the cost of goods."even though demand for consumer electronics and cars tends to be quite price sensitive and is likely to moderate with even modest price increases, we estimate reduced supply could boost prices by 1-3% in affected categories," goldman sachs analysts said. that could temporarily bump up inflation later this year, they added. chip constraints are already pushing up the price of vehicles in the united states because dealers have only a fraction of typical stock levels. the average new car price climbed to $37,200 in the first quarter, an 8.4% increase from the same period a year ago, according to jd power. about half of car buyers are paying within 5% of the sticker price, with some paying more than  pressure on supply chains has even caught the attention of us president joe biden, who ordered a review in february into which products used by americans are vulnerable to disruptions. biden said that could lead to an increase in the domestic production of certain goods. intel, meanwhile, is in talks with companies that design chips for carmakers about manufacturing those chips in its factories. if successful, intel could be producing chips within six to nine months, according to ceo pat  the meantime, expect the disruption to continue. — julia horowitz, chris isidore and will godley contributed reporting.

originally posted by pharmagang: ↑ alright team, what an awesome day. this was a huge derisk in a single announcement. this had one of the biggest question marks around it. the results of the ards trial weighed heavy on a lot. let's acknowledge how big a deal this is, a huge (75% reduction in mortality of rem-l+dex relative to dex alone) (43% reduction in mortality in their own right) deal. that is a 75% improvement on the standard of care for a disease that is killing >800 people in the us per day, reducing mortality to just 12% from 43%. this clearly shows that rem-l is an effective treatment against covid-19 ards, which is clearly still a massive unmet medical need. not only does it show this, but the fda now has:rct data for safetyrct data for biomarkers (ie. mechanism of action)rct data for a strong signal of efficacy (26% vs 42%, p= alone; 14% vs 45% in combination with dex, p=) for a cytokine-syndrome-like diseasewhy do i point this out? rem-l is also under review for regulatory pathways to market in gvhd. this gives gold standard (rct) data on all of the above for remestemcel-l, this data - as si alluded to in the cc - will aid in fda discussions regarding the best path forward for gvhd. the fda could have even agreed to hold out to review this data prior to making a binding decision on gvhd - that would explain the delays. it's not the same disease, but you know, we have some pretty clear efficacy (shown by a met primary endpoint) to show we treat gvhd. for people who aren't too familiar with stats and p values, that means that there was a 48/1000 and 6/1000 chance that this data could have happened by chance, respectively. i'm happy with those odds, as will most people - including the fda as p< is the standard for significance. i saw one dude be like "yea but they only just got under .05, this doesn't give me confidence" - i die a little reading this. you are saying that less than a 50/1000 chance of this happening by chance is insufficient evidence for you to back this result? what about the 6/1000 as a combination therapy? how many times do you need to run into a concrete wall before you finally believe it's a dumb idea? smh also, addressing eua, this is definitely on the cards - but thank god msb seem to be becoming more conservative in their estimates and saying 'another trial' right off the bat. the 4th point is demonstrated by the massive improvement on top of the current standard of care - dexamethasone. who knows, but we certainly have a worthy  looking forward, things we know:surg centre, no doubt under an nda to allow for a complete review of the internal functioning of the company, put down us$110 million at  (means there are probably no shady dealings considering they appointed a surgcentre official to the board.)novartis held out to review data for ards before deciding on the next stepseach of the pursued indications by the company reflects massive market  i consider almost certain:gruenthal european partnership money and trial initiation for clbpnovartis partnership money and trial for ards (after being told that the trial failed, what results could you possibly hope for other than what we got?a statistically significant lasting reduction in mortality up to 60 days that synergistically works with the soc and a reduction in discharge time. considering they stayed on following the trial, i don't believe in the face of this kind of data that novartis would walk - that would be insane. the ceo of novartis even gave us a shout out shortly after 1:24: _leadership-reimaginingmedicine-results-activity-6792709292706295808-t5ah/?fbclid=iwar2-zinwc_0--gmvwtegmrveiljmemos25v-lwedvtcydmeenigwvvm4khk)further sp gain on analysis of secondary markers from ards trial (similar to in january with the chf results)progression of tasly partnership in chinaeventual chf partnership for us/eu commercialisation of rexlemestrocelthings i consider moderately risky:gvhd commercialisation has been massively derisked for the reasons highlighted above - but everything the fda did with this one was weird so what's to stop them now. i think more likely to get conditional approval than not but that's just imo based on the new evidence presented by the ards  requiring a single trial. coin flip tbh. we certainly have the data to validate it, but fda wild card makes it too hard to call. regardless, i strongly believe we will get a lucrative partnership prior to  requiring a single trial. ditto, coin flip but i think chf is slightly more likely to land the right way  for covid ards. we tick all the boxes, and the pandemic calls for it, but they're not given lightly. is this the path to approval for the first approved commercial stem cell therapy in the us?all just my thoughts and not investment advice, i did top up though - following my own thought process. gang gang expand thanks gang gang - have posted on yahoo too:mesoblast limited (meso)nasdaqgs - nasdaqgs real time price. currency in usdin - (-%)at close: 4:00pm  + (%)pre-market: 4:00am edt

who won the amstel gold race? human error in photo-finishes. in the case of the car i have the following options:1. from the diagnostics port under the steering wheel i can get the speed of the car from the car's electronic control unit2. a hiking or computer gps could be used, probably anything that isn't marketed as a car gps is ok, the car gps probably makes awful tracks because they don't want you asking questions like "how much faster can i do the quarter mile if i wrap the exhaust pipe, load this software patch into the the ecu and, take out the passenger and rear seats, radio, glove box cover, wiper blades, and bumpers?"3. you could add an accelerometer and use a kalman filter to combine that with other information sources to estimate vehicle position. consumer accelerometers aren't that good, you are taking $2500 or so for one that car racers use.i analyzed it to death and came to the conclusion that 1 will be good enough for a project which is the reverse of the camera being described: that is, put a neopixel strip on the side of my car and generate i think high quality images at night if someone happens to be focused at about the right distance but not tracking the vehicle.

andrew giuliani flails when asked if rudy might flip on trump. during a more than 10-minute back and forth with erin burnett on cnn on thursday evening, andrew giuliani would not entirely rule out the “theoretical” possibility that his father, rudy giuliani, might turn on former president donald trump amidst a federal investigation into his dealings with ukraine . at one point, burnett asked the younger giuliani, who trended on twitter earlier in the week after viewers noticed a resemblance to some of will ferrell’s more belligerent characters, to respond to comments from trump’s former fixer michael cohen . “i think donald understands that rudy will provide whatever information that he has to the [southern district of new york],” cohen said, “because rudy has no interest in going to prison and spending the golden years of his life behind bars. that i’m certain of.” “so would your father turn on trump to protect himself if that’s what it takes?” burnett asked. “i can’t believe i’m answering something from michael cohen,” giuliani replied, stammering a bit before adding, “no! i mean, he has... there is… i don’t really know how to respond to this, because it’s a theoretical.” “you know, my father represented the president in good faith and i don’t—you know, this is all theoretical,” he continued. “if there was something illegal that happened—there’s nothing illegal that happened!” burnett informed giuliani that his father could face up to five years in prison just for failing to register as a foreign agent, asking how he would weigh that against sharing some details with investigators about trump’s alleged crimes. instead of answering her question, giuliani clumsily pivoted to the current president’s son hunter biden, something he attempted repeatedly throughout the interview. “well, what i would say is, i do wonder if hunter biden is going to be charged with the allegations that are out there against him,” he said. “so in terms of that, that’s where i wonder.” “i’m very confident that my dad did everything—everything that he did—on the up and up,” giuliani added. “so that’s where i’ll leave it there. i trust him. i trust his relationship with the president. and i know he's a man of integrity when it comes to his representation of the 45th president of the united states.”

wall street bonuses at risk amid new clamor to finish dodd-frank. (bloomberg) -- titans of finance, already threatened by president joe biden’s push for the biggest tax hike on wealthy americans in decades, face another peril: progressives are demanding action on a long-stalled requirement that washington clamp down on wall street bonuses. behind the scenes, consumer groups such as public citizen and better markets are reminding administration officials that the never-finished pay constraints are mandatory under the dodd-frank act. democrats -- upset that the rules languished when donald trump occupied the white house -- are also exerting pressure, arguing that years after the 2008 financial crisis, banks’ compensation practices continue to incentivize dangerous behavior. the limits are “critical to reining in the reckless wall street culture that encourages executives to juice their pay with risky, short-term gains,” massachusetts senator elizabeth warren, a well-known critic of lavish bonuses, said in a statement. “it’s long past time regulators revisit the rule and use it to prevent greedy executives from crashing our economy again.” the pay strictures are among dodd-frank’s most controversial provisions, with watchdogs putting them off even during the obama administration -- a time when the government was eager to tighten wall street’s leash. regulators had been hesitant to insert themselves into how private companies reward employees. also, because the economy can’t function if bankers completely shelve their animal spirits, it proved difficult to strike the right balance between allowing some risk but not too much. and considering how important annual bonuses are to financial executives, lobbying over the issue has been intense going back a decade. ‘never finalized’ “it’s revealing that of the hundreds of rules in dodd-frank, this is one of the few that’s never been finalized,” said bartlett naylor, a financial-policy advocate at public citizen. naylor said his group has met with biden administration officials who gave the impression that “they don’t want to let four years pass and not get this done.” “people can be highly confident” that biden’s financial watchdogs will implement the regulations, said dennis kelleher, the president of better markets, which advocates for aggressive oversight of banks and other firms. white house officials declined to comment. unlike the plan biden released this week that would fund social programs by raising taxes for the rich, the rules targeting wall street bonuses won’t have to go through congress, where major policy changes are challenged by democrats’ razor-thin senate majority. with progressives like warren and new york representative alexandria ocasio-cortez feeling emboldened by biden’s victory, the federal reserve, securities and exchange commission and other agencies will probably be urged by capitol hill to pass regulations with teeth. high-profile blowups like last month’s collapse of archegos capital management, bill hwang’s family office, aren’t helping the financial industry’s cause. the implosion contributed to more than $10 billion of combined losses for firms including credit suisse group ag, nomura holdings inc., ubs group ag and morgan stanley. fed chairman jerome powell said the incident revealed risk-management failures at a number of banks. ‘long overdue’ biden’s regulators “must complete the long overdue protections to stop executives from endangering the economy to pay themselves,” senate banking committee chairman sherrod brown, an ohio democrat, said in a statement. the language in dodd-frank, which lawmakers passed in 2010, was broad: congress required a crackdown on compensation that can trigger material losses by encouraging inappropriate risks. figuring out how to do that was left to the fed, sec, federal deposit insurance corp., office of the comptroller of the currency, federal housing finance agency and national credit union administration. a never-adopted 2016 proposal would have deferred large portions of executives’ bonuses for several years and, for an even longer period, subjected them to clawbacks or a reduction in unvested incentive pay if they engaged in misconduct. the plan focused on significant risk-takers -- employees at banks, brokerages and asset managers whose actions could be catastrophic because they had sway over huge chunks of assets. banks have long bristled that the rules are unnecessary and unfair. lenders say they proactively made changes after the 2008 crisis, like forcing executives to wait longer to receive performance-based pay and unveiling new policies to recoup bonuses following big losses and allegations of wrongdoing. such reforms were on display last year when goldman sachs group inc. clawed back pay from ex-chief executive officer lloyd blankfein and several other former managers after the firm paid more than $5 billion to settle allegations that it helped facilitate bribes as part of the 1mdb malaysian fund scandal. competitive disadvantage banks and their lawyers also say privately that no other industry faces similar federal constraints. at a time when firms are engaged in an arms race for talent with silicon valley and other sectors, adding pay rules on top of the glut of existing post-crisis regulations might prompt candidates to ask, “why bother pursuing a career in finance?” “by subjecting banks to these requirements, you’re putting them at a severe disadvantage when it comes to retention and talent,” said henry eickelberg, chief operating officer of the hr policy association, a trade group that represents human resource officers at large corporations. “you’re going to cause them to have to pay more.” wall street should have plenty of time to sharpen its lobbying strategy because imposing the limits will probably be a long-term project, despite progressives’ demands for urgency. holdovers appointed by trump still run some of the relevant agencies, and biden won’t be able have all his nominees in place for another two years. it’s also expected to take a while for six different watchdogs to agree on how to proceed, write the rules, propose them and then approve an overhaul. a key figure in the debate will be sec chairman gary gensler because the agency was a major driver of the 2016 proposal and an earlier one released in 2011. the former goldman sachs partner gained a reputation as a hard-nosed regulator and wall street adversary when he ran the commodity futures trading commission during the obama administration. the heads of the six agencies haven’t met to discuss the pay constraints since biden’s inauguration. the occ “remains committed to implementing the rules required by law,” said spokesman bryan hubbard, who added that regulators have issued guidelines that nudged the industry to change its practices. spokespeople for the other agencies declined to comment. progressives’ ideas when regulators start evaluating what to do, they will have no shortage of ideas from progressives to consider. for instance, sarah anderson, who directs the global economy project at the institute for policy studies, would like to see senior executives put some of their bonus money into central pots that would be tapped if their firms are fined by regulators -- so managers have stakes in the punishments. “that would do a lot to change the culture on wall street,” she said. “as long as we have such massive bonuses, it’s just very difficult to have confidence in the banking system that people aren’t going to take really reckless actions to hit those jackpots.” ©2021 bloomberg
yes i did, "goldspot is effecting the bid at this time as it believes that its common shares are undervalued at their current market prices and that the purchase of common shares would be a prudent use of funds." sounds good to me 👍

hugging and going into pubs among rules changing from may 17. kent hotels, museums, and cinemas will finally be allowed to reopen we are just over two weeks away from the next easing of restrictions in england. after hairdressers, gyms, shops and restaurants all reopened on april 12 the next benchmark will see even more significant changes. it’s the latest step on the roadmap out of lockdown which could see all restrictions lifted by june 21. may 17 will be the first day that two households are able to meet indoors for the first time since christmas. at present, if only two households are meeting there is no cap on the number of people attending, but they must meet outdoors until may 17. as well as the mixing of households indoors from mid-may, indoor hospitality will also be allowed to reopen, alongside museums, cinemas and hotels. these measures will be the third part of the reopening from lockdown. from mid-may, groups of up to six people and two households will be allowed to meet in each other's homes. health secretary matt hancock has given the go-ahead for family members to hug each other from may 17, although he maintained people should stay "cautious" until then. as part of this next stage of the reopening, weddings, receptions, wakes, funerals, and other life events such as christenings can be attended by up to 30 people. while pubs and restaurants can only serve customers al fresco at present, they will be able to open their doors in earnest from may 17. the rule of six and allowance for two households to meet will be introduced indoors as well, so two families can meet for a pub lunch inside. meanwhile, these rules will no longer apply outdoors, when people will be able to meet in groups of up to 30 in beer gardens or when dining outside. hotels, bed and breakfast establishments and indoor gym classes will be allowed to open in this third phase of the reopening. entertainment venues such as cinemas and theatres will reopen as well, with specific rules in place for venues of different sizes. outdoor events will be permitted to open for whichever is smaller: up to 4,000 people or half of the venue capacity indoor events will similarly be allowed to open for whichever is lower: up to 1,000 people or half the capacity. meanwhile, for huge outdoor seated events, such as matches at wembley stadium, there is a limit of up to 10,000 attendees or a quarter of the capacity, whichever is lower. international holiday travel will be permitted from may 17, with a traffic light system in place that classes countries as red, amber or green on travel lists. for those travelling to countries on the amber or red lists, passengers will be required to quarantine upon return to the uk. holidaymakers will only be able to return if they have a negative coronavirus test within 72 hours of departure and will also be required to have at least one test after arrival in england. travellers will have to purchase and take gold standard pcr tests upon their return to the uk - which come in at around £120 each and could rack up quite an extra cost for families. yet, after covid-19 testing firms were accused of profiteering, the government is reportedly considering plans to exempt pcr tests from vat, which means costs could fall to around £50 per test. also as part of the third phase of the reopening from may 17, university students will be able to return to in person teaching on campus, replacing virtual lectures. the fourth stage of the roadmap out of lockdown, which will come into force no earlier than june 21, should see "all legal limits on social contact" removed. health secretary matt hancock has confirmed the dates set will not be brought forward. the reopening measures will go ahead on the proposed dates as long as the corresponding coronavirus data does not take an adverse turn. the four statistical areas which will determine the speed of the reopening are the vaccine roll-out, the covid-19 deaths and hospitalisations, the covid-19 case numbers and the emergence of new variants. as of april 28, a total of 33,959,908 people have received one dose of the vaccine, with  people having received both jabs.

bnp paribas beats expectations for q1 as equity trading rebounds. paris (reuters) -france's bnp paribas on friday reported a better-than-expected first-quarter profit, helped by lower provisions for pandemic-related bad loans and a rebound in its equity trading business.    popular searches    the euro zone's biggest listed lender said net profit rose 37.9% to  billion euros ($ billion) from a year earlier, beating a mean forecast for  billion in a poll of analysts compiled by refinitiv. revenue was up 8.6% at  billion euros, above the 11.2 billion expected by analysts. in its corporate and investment banking activities, revenue rose by 24.3%, spurred by a 41.4% jump in its markets business. bnp paribas said a rebound in equity trading offset a 15.7% drop in fixed income, currencies and commodities trading. "primary, credit and commodity derivatives activities performed very well but the context was less favourable than in the first quarter of 2020 for rates and forex activities," the lender said in a statement. it reported no impact from the implosion of  investment fund archegos, which has caused more than $10 billion of losses across other global banks. bnp's equity business brought in 697 million euros, a strong showing compared with a year ago, when widespread dividend suspensions wiped out all of its earnings. however, its larger fixed income, commodity and currency business lagged rivals. deutsche bank's fixed-income and currency sales revenue increased 34% while goldman sachs reported a 31% rise in such trading. bnp paribas, which said two months ago that the worst of the global coronavirus crisis was over for its loan book, said it expected the economy to gradually recover from the pandemic. its cost of risk, which reflects provisions for bad loans, was down 37% to 896 million euros. shares in bnp paribas have gained 24.7% so far this year, outperforming a 23.8% rise for the stoxx europe 600 banks index.

stocks - ford. idea for ford motor company: - we believe that a macro turn is here. - as the global economy moves toward stagflation, and perhaps deflation, investors will decrease their risk appetite appropriate for a goldilocks economy, and will rotate from momentum and consumer discretionary stocks to quality, consumer staples, utilities, dividend yields, and defensives stocks. - we believe that ford is an excellent defensive stock, traditionally being a dividend yielding stock and having being in operation for over 100 years. - ford is a good pick even before moving into a stagflation economy, because they have exposure to the tech and industrials sector, with their introduction of evs , and their 13.9% us market share of the automobile industry, coming second only to gm . - ford transitioned away from sedans, and announced that almost 90% of its north american model selection will consist of trucks and commercial vehicles. we believe that this is a most excellent choice, and are impressed by this decision making. - we foresee a ravenous appetite in the supply chain sector, due to (a) covid shipping backlog, which will only increase should covid mutate and cause further lockdowns, (b) nations moving toward domestic production, which will increase intranational logistics and infrastructure demands, and (c) a shift from a software-oriented tech boom to a boom in the industrials and capital goods sector, from what we perceive is being attempted with the us stimulus packages. - the price is technically in what appears to be a wyckoff accumulation cycle, and is showing signs of strength. - we believe that a better entry is possible, as it tests support levels during market volatility which we expect, but still it is a good entry point for a longer time-frame. glhf, dpt disclaimer: we absolutely do not provide financial advice in any shape or form. we do not recommend investing based on our opinions and strongly cautions that securities trading and investment involves high risk and that you can lose a lot of money. loss of principal is possible. we do not recommend risking money you cannot afford to lose. we do not guarantee future performance nor accuracy in historical analyses. we are not registered investment advisors. our ideas, opinions and statements are not a substitute for professional investment advice. we provide ideas containing impersonal market observations and our opinions. our speculations may be used in preparation to form your own ideas.

li juxin: after the correction of gold, it continues to fall, and gold trend analysis and operation suggestions. on april 30, there is currently no obvious trend in the short-term cycle. the  index tends to stabilize the wave and pull up, but the bullish trend of the gold 4-hour cycle does not change, and the short trend fails to form, so it will not directly fall. the trend is uncertain and the long and short rhythms change back and forth. in the operation layout, it is necessary to wait patiently for the support and resistance to be touched, and seek stable opportunities for the layout. today&#39;s market is analyzed from the following points: 1. the market&#39;s high and low points continue to move downwards, and the short-term trend is weak; but the daily yin and yang alternate, which is an obvious shock signal; the 4-hour cycle is not broken at 745, and it is still in a bull trend. different cycles and strengths give different signals. the market is in a state of contention between longs and shorts. you should not rush to chase up or down, but focus on resistance to support high, low, and low. 2. from the perspective of the graphic form, 1798-1796-1790 above forms a downward trend line, and the resistance is near 1788; at the same time, the resistance of the golden section of 1790-1756 is  at 1783. the most important resistance range that the market pays attention to is 1782-1788. when it touches this area, it is short, stop loss is 1792, and the profit target is 1774 and 1768. 3. the main support of the market is at 1752, which is the trend line connection of 1769-1763-1756. the line support is again the  position of the golden section of 1790-1763, but the shock market will not touch 1752 unless the price wants to choose the direction of the market. in the short term, we first focus on the support of the 1760-1764 area. when it comes to considering short-term and long-term, stop loss is 1754, and the profit target is 1774 and 1780. in summary, gold adopts a high-altitude, low-to-multiple layout during the day. reached 1782-1786 empty, stop loss 1792, take profit 1774, 1768; touched 1762 short long, stop loss 1754, take profit target 1774, 1780

great green wall promises better lives to african farmers. by richard wetaya once complete, it will reportedly be the largest living structure on the planet, covering an area 8,000 km long by 17 km wide – three times the size of the great barrier reef – and stretching across the entire continent. with the fresh infusion of funds – obtained at the paris-one planet summit for biodiversity – it is anticipated that hard-pressed pastoral and agricultural communities long challenged by poverty and persistent food insecurity in the sahel and horn of africa regions will enjoy better lives. diarra fatoumata, a 38-year-old mother of four, is from one of those farming communities – koremairwa village in the doutchi district of southwestern niger. she is one of many smallholder farmers who recently received improved millet and maize seeds, courtesy of the initiative. “my farming prospects have gotten better on account of using improved grain seeds,” she said recently. she elaborated: “previously, some of the seeds i used to plant would germinate but the crops would wither and die off. with the new seeds, i am now able to produce and harvest sturdier crops, which have a better market value. “together with other smallholder farmers from my village and other areas of the sahel, we have also attained training on appropriate crop rotation and how to use small-scale irrigation for crop production and for extending farming activities into the dry season.” for good measure, a number of smallholder farmers in sudan, eritrea, ethiopia and djibouti were also trained in proper agroforestry, water harvesting and irrigation practices and on how to create shelterbelts for their farmlands. “shelterbelts are now helping many farmers in controlling soil erosion in sudan,” said abdel aldai, a wheat and maize farmer in karima, sudan. he added: “with agroforestry, we were taught how to integrate trees, which are helpful in climate change mitigation, into our farming activities, with an aim of achieving better productivity by tapping into the ecosystem amenities supplied by trees.” agricultural and environment policy analysts reckon that the additional funding vouchsafed by the french government, the african development bank, the world bank, the european commission and other sources will breathe new life into the initiative. the initiative has just under a decade to achieve its goals of creating 10 million green jobs, sequestering 250 million tonnes of carbon, restoring 100 million hectares of degraded land and protecting africa’s biodiversity, while reducing poverty and food insecurity. its mediocre progress to date was highlighted in a united nations status report, great green wall: implementation status and way ahead to 2030, released last year. the report found that the though the initiative was more than halfway to its 2030 completion date, it had only covered 4 per cent of its target area. the findings did make for good reading in some african ecological and environmental research think tank circles. “for some, it was an indictment on the people in charge of the initiative,” said faustin banjoko, a climate action and development policy expert. he added: “it also lent credence to schools of thought that held that zero net degradation and dryland tree planting (afforestation) in the 7 million square kilometers sahel region would face long odds, as had been the case with the north african green dam project.” by all accounts, however, the initiative’s execution shortfalls were due to deficiencies in funding and technical support. now those obstacles seem to be out of the way. godfrey oluka, an environment specialist at the united nations development programme, said the new funding – in a year, that marks the beginning of the un’s decade for ecosystem restoration – may just be the silver lining the initiative needed. “it is a welcome development. it will hopefully draw forth a renewed urgency in executing the initiative’s targets – that is, the restoration of degraded land in the sahel, a region that experiences a 3 per cent decline in agricultural production, per year, due to land degradation. the region has in the last 30 years been devastated by severe drought and massive loss of fertile land, due to climate change and over-farming, and the enhancement of agricultural production systems in the rest of the great green wall (ggw) intervention zones, represented by ethiopia, eritrea, mauritania and djibouti,” oluka said. banjoko elaborated: “on the face of it, there is a lot of progress being made in the ggw nations especially in the areas of promoting agroforestry, improving livestock breeding, providing green jobs, creating shelter belts for farmlands, improving irrigation efficiency for agricultural production, strengthening climate resilience and boosting pastoral and agro-pastoral regenerative agricultural production. “these will, in the course of time, all translate into better incomes and a better food security status quo.” because crop production in the sahel is for the most part rain-fed with limited irrigated agriculture, several smallholding traditional agriculture farmers in countries like niger, burkina faso and mali have been getting apprenticeships on the improved use of sprinkle and drip surface irrigation techniques and on proper rainwater harvesting practices. there was further good news for farmers when the green climate fund and the international fund for agricultural development recently announced that they had a pipeline investment project called the great green wall umbrella programme (ggw up). it would ostensibly boost climate finance for the ggw nation’s rural populations and would ensure that small-scale farmers and agribusinesses have better access to markets and strengthened value chains, creating economic opportunities and jobs, through the development of climate-resilient infrastructure and expanding the use of solar energy. speaking at the one planet summit, susan gardner, director of the un’s environment programme’s ecosystems division, said the initiative was an inspiring example of ecosystem restoration in action. “this initiative alone will not transform the sahel’s fortunes overnight but will rapidly become a green growth corridor that will bring investment, boost food security, create jobs and sow the seeds of peace,” she noted. in recent years, however, there have been growing concerns that the ongoing conflict in central sahel would slow down progress, particularly in mali, burkina faso and niger. there are already grim realities on the ground with statistics from the international organisation for migration’s displacement tracking matrix indicating that over 1.5 million people have been internally displaced by the ongoing crises in the three nations. notwithstanding that, there are pointers to strides being made. during a recent international forest day forward thinkers webinar, louise baker, managing director of the un convention to combat desertification global mechanism, said about 20 per cent of the project’s target area has now been completed. “all partners are working assiduously towards the initiative’s 2030 targets,” she said, adding: “eighteen million hectares of the proposed 100 million land hectares have been restored, 350,000 green jobs out of the proposed 10 million have been created and about us$90 million generated by communities in the initiative’s intervention zone.” on the green economy front, the anticipation is that by the initiative’s completion point, 8,000 kilometers of the intervention zone’s land area will be covered with a mosaic of trees and plants. thus far, more than 5 million hectares of degraded land have been restored in niger and 12 million trees planted in senegal. some 15 million land hectares have been restored in ethiopia; 29,602 hectares in burkina faso; 52,930 hectares in eritrea, and 120 hectares of land in mali, among other places. according to the un report, land restoration in the project intervention zones positively impacted 15 of the 17 global sustainable development goals (sdgs). by all accounts, the us$90 million generated helped to reduce rural poverty in the intervention zones. baker is upbeat about the initiative’s prospects. “this initiative will not come up short like previous tree planting ecological projects on the continent. the difference is that it is owned and implemented by communities and countries themselves,” she said. she added: “each country has designated a protected area dedicated to activities along the great green wall, managed by their local communities. “a unique practice known as rainwater harvesting which collects the heavy annual rainfall and distributes it through irrigation systems, is one of the ways in which the great green wall is sustained. sustainability of this programme is already being owned by the communities.”

shi jinyuan: gold and silver soaring and falling markets and latest price trend operation suggestions. market trend analysis: april 30, gold news analysis: thursday () gold technical: today&#39;s gold market is after the asian market rushed higher and the entire european market fell, so the current market day is considered to belong weak, but from the perspective of the trend, yesterday&#39;s price broke the high point of the rebound before the last decline in 1785, and there are signs of strengthening on the trend. but the key support is the 1762 position. if this position falls below, then the whole trend will reverse and become a very weak movement. however, regardless of the trend, in the case of intraday weakening, because the us is a rebound before the market, then the us the probability of a second dip after the market is relatively high. if the us market drops twice and breaks the current low, then it is a continuation of the short position. today&#39;s us market operation is to consider rebounding and shorting. the current pressure on the top of gold is 1779-1781-1783, which are 382-0.5-618 after the intraday high of 1798 fell, and the high point of rebound after the first fall below 1780 in the european market is near 1782. , and the support below is the 1766 position, which is the starting point for the ascent of the 4-hour chart level yesterday, and the low point of 1762 yesterday. gold today&#39;s suggestion is to go short in the 1781-83 area, stop loss at 1788, and target at 1773. gold is currently uncertain whether the market trend is long or short. after all, after yesterday’s rise, today’s retracement is greater. if the retracement of this wave is lower than 1762, the next time it rises again, then the market is on the high side. rising, the next time if it breaks the high point of 1789 today, then the 1800 will be at risk of breaking, and if today’s price retracement falls below the position of 1762 or after today’s decline, tomorrow will extend its downward trend to break the situation of 1762, then this is the reversal of the entire trend. after falling below 1762, the decline may be very large, in the 1730-1720 area. this is the general expectation. on the whole, today&#39;s gold short-term operation ideas suggest that the callback is mainly long, and the rebound short is supplemented. the top focus is on the first-line resistance of 1780-1785, and the short-term below focuses on the first-line support of 1740-1745.

treasure hunters hope to dig up 48 chests of "himmler’s gold" buried in poland. treasure hunters from the silesian bridge foundation have already established the supposed location of the german nazi treasure. uk daily  the sun  reported that the team is to begin excavating next week at an 18 th century palace in the town of minkowskie in southern poland. there may be up to 10 tons of gold and other riches to be found in 48 chests, worth more than eur 547 million. the valuables were supposedly stolen at the end of the second world war on the orders of the leader of the ss, heinrich himmler himself. among the treasure, there is said to be jewelry belonging to german elites, who wanted to hide their valuables from the approaching red army, and the legendary “gold of wroclaw,” which had disappeared from the wroclaw bank at the end of the war. the team from the silesian bridge foundation examined documents that contained clues concerning the chests’ hidden location. these included a journal of an ss officer under the pseudonym “michaelis” and a map received from the descendants of another german officer. an entry in the journal from march 12, 1945, discusses the treasure stash at the palace in minkowskie: "a ditch has been dug in the orangery, which is a safe 'home' for the delivered chests and containers.” the officer also described other hidden treasures, but the team decided to focus on the stash in minkowskie palace because it was easily accessible. another clue concerning the hidden chests was the letter of a german officer named von stein to a woman who worked in the palace and later became his lover. “my dear inge, i will fulfill my assignment, with god's will. some transports were successful. the remaining 48 heavy reichsbank chests and all the family chests i hereby entrust to you. only you know where they are located. may god help you and help me fulfill my assignment,” von stein wrote.

biden’s capital gains tax plan to pull crypto down to earth from the moon?. there are often multiple causes for an asset’s sharp decline, but bitcoin’s ( btc ) 10% “nosedive,” which took place on april 22, may be blamed on the biden administration’s reported plan to tax capital gains at double the current rate on america’s wealthiest.  bitcoin is habitually volatile, so one probably shouldn’t read too much into a double-digit swoon in any given week, but this might be as good a place as any to reflect upon the possible impact of the united states capital gains taxes, and taxes in general, upon the future growth of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. could it hinder long-term adoption? if so, in what ways? will the biden plan even reach fruition, given the vagaries of  politics? how, too, does one explain the mini-market eruption in the face of the mere possibility  of more taxes in a single nation? what sorts of misperceptions might we be harboring with regard to crypto taxation generally? “the price drop can probably be attributed to a number of factors and rumors — chiefly, the month-end expiration of future positions, which resulted in a liquidation of positions that triggered a slide,” markus veith, a partner in the audit practice at grant thornton llp and leader of the firm’s digital assets practice, told cointelegraph. there were also reports, generally thought to be false, that treasury secretary janet yellen was spearheading an effort to impose an 80% capital gains tax rate on cryptocurrencies, “as well as rumors that the  treasury was investigating financial institutions for illicit use of cryptocurrencies, which the doj would do, not the treasury,” added veith, continuing: “then, there were also comments about a drop in chinese mining capacity.” a lot was happening that week david trainer, ceo of investment research firm new constructs, downplayed the btc price gyrations, stating: “10% volatility is nothing new for btc and crypto in general.” meanwhile, tyler menzer, a cpa and doctoral student in accounting at the university of iowa, noted: “while the tax news does coincide with the drop, it may only be one of many contributing factors.” but taxes do matter. “the [biden] proposal would put the effective tax rate at above 50% in certain states and would be detrimental to job creation,” carlos betancourt, co-founder of bkcoin capital in miami, told newsweek, adding, “and would continue to accelerate the move from states like california and new york to more tax-friendly states like florida and texas that have no state income tax.” this is still an early stage in a new administration, of course, and there is some question whether a doubling of the capital gains on the wealthiest to 39.6% — as proposed — will even make it through congress intact, or if that rate will eventually be reduced. “someone needs to pay for all the stimulus, deficits, and national debt, so very likely you would see a tax increase in the near future — whether on capital gains or something else is still to be decided,” mazhar wani, a pricewaterhousecoopers tax partner in san francisco, told cointelegraph. however, omri marian, professor of law at the university of california, irvine school of law, said that the proposal will unlikely be accepted in its current form. “the democratic majority in congress is just too narrow for this,” marian informed cointelegraph. chris weston, head of research at the pepperstone group — a forex broker — said: “the numbers being proposed at this juncture will unlikely pass the senate in its current form, and centrist democrats will not back the touted numbers.” but casting rumors aside, if a doubling of the capital gains tax does pass through congress intact, would it necessarily mean stormy weather for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology? maybe not. nathan goldman, assistant professor of accounting at north carolina state university, told cointelegraph — after consulting with his co-author on btc taxation matters, christina lewellen — that the new capital gains taxes are geared to the wealthiest — those with more than $1 million in annual income — and they would be paid only upon the sale of the digital asset: “as a result, it is not clear whether the proposed changes would significantly affect most cryptocurrency holders.” still, “taxes likely do have an effect on bitcoin prices,” said menzer, continuing, “as we have a lot of prior research on a wide variety of outcomes and aspects of life that are affected by tax rates, especially in the financial sector.” moreover, they could push crypto and blockchain technology in some interesting directions. wani, for example, would expect to see more “short-term volatility due to certain investors cashing out at the lower rates, but long term, you may see more demand for defi applications and other collateralized use cases to create liquidity and avoid triggering gains.” what about murmurs surrounding yellen’s so-called 80% capital gains tax — which would be “punitive and unprecedented”? goldman told cointelegraph, “i do not believe there is strong merit to the rumors of an 80% capital gains tax on cryptocurrency” — a position echoed elsewhere. but some still believe that yellen hasn’t really warmed to crypto. “my own view is yellen fundamentally doesn’t get bitcoin,” weston said, continuing, “and to go after digital assets to protect against criminal activity in an asset that leaves a record is odd” particularly because cash is usually favored in such transactions, given its untraceability. meanwhile, trainer added: “i think janet yellen was looking to minimize the speculation in crypto. she believes that rampant speculation, like what we see in crypto, is not healthy for investors or the underlying asset over time.” with regard to the capital gains issue in general, menzner commented: “to the extent that higher taxes make it more expensive to use cryptocurrency or adopt it for new uses, it will be a setback.” however, he added: “it could also accelerate the use of stablecoins for certain cryptocurrency projects, as they are designed to minimize price fluctuations and thus minimize any gain or loss from a tax perspective.” “we don’t often see tax as the controlling decision of whether to exit a position, but it may drive when an exit occurs; for example, if any corresponding losses should be harvested, when long-term/short-term holding periods are met, etc.,” paul beecy, tax services partner at grant thornton llp, told cointelegraph. does  tax policy matter globally? to what extent, though, is this all just a  issue? does it really even matter in singapore or france what happens in the  with regard to tax policy — especially for a globally purchased and held asset like bitcoin? “competitive advantage is key here,” according to wani, who added: “it matters if other countries follow similar policies for taxation.” also, he believes other countries may try to become more competitive by offering “more incentives — , less taxation — to attract more talent and businesses from this growing industry to their jurisdictions.” “the only thing i can definitively say on how much  tax policy affects crypto is that we don’t know,” added menzer, but “ policy can cause real changes in crypto-exchange economics.” many global exchanges do not allow  residents and citizens to trade, for example, thanks to  policy, “thus effectively separating non- traders from  traders, which slightly breaks down the idea that bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are uniformly global.” it matters, said marian, because “if you are a  taxpayer, you owe  taxes on your crypto trades no matter how you make them. it may be more difficult for the irs to enforce if you hold your assets with a foreign custodian. but if you cheat on purpose, you wouldn’t care very much about a change in tax rates.” what does seem clear is the lack of clarity with regard to taxes and cryptocurrencies, starting with the common misperception that you do not need to pay taxes on crypto. according to goldman: “you still need to pay taxes on the appreciation of your cryptocurrency assets. for example, if you bought a single bitcoin on jan. 1, 2016, for $434 and used that bitcoin to buy a tesla on april 1, 2021 — value $58,726 — you owe capital gains taxes on the difference.” no hard and fast rulesmore problematic still, there is no standard tax treatment for all cryptocurrency uses. as beecy told cointelegraph: “when digital currency is held [in the ] by individual retail investors as a capital asset, the tax rules on buying and selling it are reasonably understood, and the capital gains tax that applies ought to impact digital currency transactions in a manner very similar to other financial capital assets.” but when, by contrast, digital currency is structured as part of more complex transactions “and mimics other and more esoteric financial instruments — like derivatives, nfts [nonfungible tokens], and certain security tokens — then the tax rules on those digital currency transactions are not really clear,” said beecy. all in all, last week’s btc’s price gyrations might have been an over-reaction to some preliminary tax plans, but this response was probably predictable, given that “regulation is obviously a major grey cloud” that begets anxiety, as weston noted, “but as we’ve seen many times of late, the market sells first, thinks about it, and calmer heads generally prevail.” taxation, of course, is a serious business, and even if doubling of the capital gains tax only directly impacts the wealthiest, history teaches that taxes can have a leveraged impact on long-term growth — so, one needs to pay attention. taxation is a form of regulation, and the mere fact that discussions like this are taking place in crypto’s only 12th year of existence may provide some confidence, arguably, that the  is not going to ban or attempt to “shut down” cryptocurrencies. indeed, the net effect could be an “increase [in] adoption as people feel more confident,” submitted menzer.

nigel farage: brexiteer, scourge of the woke – and eco-warrior?. file photo: british brexit party leader nigel farage speaks during a visit at dover harbour, in dover by susanna twidale london (reuters) – love him or hate him, it’s hard to accuse nigel farage of being boring or predictable – and britain’s brexit champion has blindsided his critics once again. fresh from leaving politics, the most high-profile face of the campaign to leave the european union has joined the advisory board of a dutch carbon offset company aiming to plant three trillion trees by 2030. it may seem an unlikely career choice for a man who has been scathing about wind power, criticised some environmental campaigners for what he called climate alarmism and declared war on the “woke agenda”. yet farage said the attraction of the new role, as an adviser and spokesman with amsterdam-listed carbon offset company dutch green business (dgb), was about conservation and nature rather than just combating climate change – on which he says the science is still not completely settled. “i think people will want to plant trees and increase biodiversity through dgb who are actually quite sceptical about climate change. equally there will be others who are very concerned about it,” the 57-year-old told reuters. “if their motivations are more about biodiversity than they are about climate change, so what?” he said. dgb ceo selwyn duijvestijn said the very image that made farage appear an unlikely choice would help to broaden the company’s message to reach people beyond those traditionally interested in nature. “50% of the world love the greta thunbergs of this world to bring them the message that nature is important, but then there is the other 50% … the oil workers in texas for instance … and they would rather listen to nigel,” duijvestijn said. yet some established figures in the carbon market expressed concern over the appointment. “we are astonished that an organisation that, presumably, seeks to be seen as credible, has enlisted as a spokesperson and adviser someone who has wilfully impeded progress on climate action by sowing doubt about the reality and urgency of climate change,” said sarah leugers, director of communications at gold standard, one of the biggest carbon offset registries. dgb’s first offsets have been bought from a forest project in sierra leone from established decarbonisation project developer south pole but duijvestijn says it expects to develop future projects itself. farage’s entrance may force dgb to hasten that transition; south pole said it was concerned about his appointment and had decided to forgo future agreements with the company. responding to the criticisms, dgb said farage was an agent for change who can be “a force for good” in championing reforestation. carbon offsets, or credits, are generated by emissions-reduction projects, such as tree planting or shifts to less polluting fuels. these credits are then bought by companies or individuals to help compensate for their own emissions. currently the market is small, with a mostly bilateral, project by project approach. but with more and more companies announcing net-zero climate targets, the market is expected to balloon over the coming years, attracting more financial institutions. some exchanges, such as cme, have launched futures offset contracts this year, and dgb said it hoped to harness the commodities expertise of farage, who spent years as a trader on the london metal exchange.

indian media report 25,000 turnout for final day of religious ceremony amidst soaring covid-19 infections. around 25,000 people turned up for the final day of a religious river dipping ceremony in the indian city of haridwar, uttarakhand, on april 27, indian media  reported . known as the shahi snan (royal bath), the event was part of one of the world's largest religious festivals, known as the kumbh mela , in which pilgrims immerse themselves in the ganges river to cleanse their sins. the event took place on april 27 as india reels from a second wave of covid-19, and the country's daily cases have been setting and breaking its own record , with over 300,000 new cases recorded each day for the past week. a curfew was subsequently imposed on the city the day after, on april 28, and will be in effect until may 3. kumbh mela inspector-general: attendees wore masks and adhered to social distancing  the inspector-general of the kumbh mela, sanjay gunjyal, was further quoted by the indian express as saying that the akharas (religious groups) had helped to keep the crowd low, while attendees of the festivals had worn masks and adhered to social distancing. he added that this followed an appeal by india's prime minister narendra modi, on april 17, that participation in the festival be done in a "symbolic" manner. sanjay also highlighted that police personnel had also been part of the event, while he had visited each akhara's camp to ensure that attendance was restricted. however, a different image of the event was reported by the scroll which said that for days in which a shahi snan was held (april 12, april 14 and april 27), testing, mask-wearing, thermal-screening, and the checking of negative test reports were ignored. a similar image was also reported by  the print  which noted that there was no social distancing or wearing of masks. uttarakhand: people take holy dip in river ganga in haridwar on chitra purnima today. the last 'shahi snan' of #kumbhmela2021 is taking place today.  — ani () april 27, 2021 cancellation of festival was ruled out  modi has since been criticised for initially endorsing the festival and intervening too late. the scroll  further reported that the state's chief minister dismissed the comparison to another religious gathering, the tablighi jamaat gathering in march 2020, which saw a few thousand muslims gather at the nizamuddin markaz mosque in new delhi. the gathering was later linked to a number of covid-19 clusters around the country. he was quoted as saying : "they [markaz attendees] were all inside a building and here it is out in the open and this is near the ganges. the flow and blessings of ma ganga will ensure that coronavirus does not spread. the question does not arise of a comparison." state officials also ruled out cancelling the festival despite 2,000 testing positive for the virus over a period of five days. india sets new daily covid-19 record  as of april 29, india's total number of covid-19 cases crossed the 18-million mark, according to reuters ,  with 379,257 new cases and 3,645 new deaths — the highest number of daily deaths since the pandemic began. hospitals, morgues and crematoriums have been overwhelmed while indian netizens have complained online that they have not been able to sign up or register for vaccination slots as the website has repeatedly crashed. however, a statement by the government issued on april 28 said, "statistics indicate that far from crashing or performing slowly, the system is performing without any glitches." top image screenshot from global news youtube

julia james: women and children urged not to enter kent woodland alone after pcso murdered on dog walk. women have been warned not to enter woods in  alone or veer from their usual routes as detectives continue to hunt for the killer of police community support officer julia james. behind her house suffering reported severe head injuries at 4pm in snowdown on tuesday afternoon with her loyal jack russell, toby, by her side. patrolling the village, near , told women to stay away from wooded areas and not to “veer from your normal route” when walking home, a grandmother who lives nearby, who asked not to be named, said: “i walk through woods in our home always on my own or with my grandson and my dog and you expect to be safe, don’t you? “i will be more vigilant, be more aware and be more careful when i go out at the moment.” colleagues left flowers for her with a note saying “your duty is done. take it easy for now we will take it from here!” from “the guys in blue”. and locals also reported that another female dog walker was confronted by a prowler in a white van a fortnight before the . the sun reported the driver was distracted and the terrified woman managed to flee and call for help. a spokesman for kent police responding to these claims said: “this is a live investigation and we continue to carry out enquiries to establish the circumstances. “we will not be commenting or speculating on any individual lines of enquiry at this time.” parts of snowdown continue to be cordoned off as the investigation continues, but police have yet to make any arrests over the 53-year-old’s killing. the hamlet, surrounded by fields, lies less than three miles from the village of chillenden where lin russell and her six-year-old daughter megan were killed in a savage attack in july 1996 while walking their dogs. members of the public are being urged to come forward with any information as police pursue “a number of lines of inquiry”. on thursday, forensic specialists wearing white suits were seen working outside a tent in a nearby field while uniformed officers patrolled the area. the field has been an early focus of the murder inquiry, with the white tent erected just 200 metres from ms james’ home. ms james, whose body was found in akholt wood earlier this week, was last seen while out walking her dog, according to reports. her nephew karl james described his aunt as “just a lovely person”. speaking to 5 news, he said: “obviously it’s been a real shock. i work away, but my wife is here – heavily pregnant – and with young kids, so she’s on edge at the moment too. “so i’ve come home and just waiting for answers – that’s the worst bit really.” meanwhile, a uniformed police officer remained outside the home in snowdown where ms james is believed to have lived. the murder came as a shock to a small community, with resident john miller, 72, describing it as a “hell of a loss”. he told the pa news agency: “i can’t believe it’s true to be honest, everyone feels safe round here.” mary bossen, identified by sky news as ms james’ cousin, said the family are “devastated”. she told sky news: “it’s just so horrible, nobody knows what happened really do they? “we all walk our dogs along there, all of us, it’s just terrible.” police are still urging anyone with information to come forward as they investigate the murder of ms james. the death was originally viewed as “suspicious” but kent police confirmed on wednesday afternoon that it is being treated as murder. assistant chief constable tom richards said it was “vitally important” that anyone who was in the area on monday and tuesday, who may have seen something suspicious, comes forward. officers are keen to speak to anyone who was in the area on monday and tuesday april 26-27 who may have seen something unusual or suspicious. they are encouraged to contact kent police on 0800 0514 526. anyone with video footage can submit it online at -po1 read more

"the benefits of coupling ethereum with bitcoin cash: smartbch sidechain testnet is now public. the benefits of coupling ethereum with bitcoin cash: smartbch sidechain testnet is now public
on thursday, the smart bitcoin cash team announced the launch of the smartbch testnet explaining that developers and decentralized app makers can now experiment and develop with the high-performance, evm-compatible bitcoin cash sidechain. further,  news spoke with wang kui the lead developer of the smartbch project. the smartbch tech lead told our newsdesk about the inner workings of the sidechain that can connect with the ethereum network.
testnet for smart bitcoin cash, a bitcoin cash layer-2 project is live
during the last few weeks, the smartbch project has been a topical conversation within the bitcoin cash (bch) community. the reason for these conversations is because the smartbch team has revealed a project that is evm and web3 compatible, but far cheaper in terms of transaction fees. this is because the smartbch project is a sidechain built on bitcoin cash and it leverages the bch chain’s lower transaction fees.  has reported on the project on a few occasions since it was announced and on april 29, the team has revealed the smartbch testnet is now live.
the smartbch testnet will allow decentralized application (dapp) creators and programmers the ability to test and deploy experimental projects using the testing framework. developers should read the recently published smartbch testnet documentation before getting started. the team’s testnet announcement notes that the bch community has been waiting for this project to go live, and said the project telegram channel has swelled with members.
for instance, the coinflex exchange has had its development team testing the testnet of smartbch while it was still private. “metamask is connecting without issue and solidity code is working well. we set up a dex on our private testnet, created tokens…and it’s all going smoothly,” mark lamb, ceo of coinflex said. the smartbch team says the concept is the first-of-its-kind sidechain for bitcoin cash and there are many benefits bch offers.
“bitcoin cash itself is not specifically equipped for smart contracting functions, preferring use cases centered around peer-to-peer cash,” the smartbch team said on wednesday. “however, as a sidechain to bitcoin cash, smartbch aims to build a new playground for the bitcoin cash ecosystem and enlarge the user base.” wang kui the lead developer of the smartbch further discussed the protocol with  news this week.
wang kui stresses that the protocol provides an evm and web3 compatible sidechain for bitcoin cash, staking its hash power while utilizing bch as the native gas-paying token. “what’s more, by incorporating hardware-friendly components, vastly increased scalability is unlocked,” kui remarked. moreover, the smartbch tech lead discussed the project in great detail with  news in an exclusive interview transcribed below.
if (!) { (function () { var s = ('script');  = true;  = 'text/javascript';  = ''; var n = (""script"")[0]; (s, n); }()); } var growjs = growjs || {};  =  || []; ({ node: , handler: function (node) { var banner = (node, 31, [300, 250], null, []); (); } });
an in-depth interview with the smart bitcoin cash tech lead wang kui
news (bcn): what made you decide to start such a venture and why did you choose to leverage the bitcoin cash network?
wang kui (wk): i have been talking about the project background, since the second half of 2018, i have been working on how to maximize tps (transactions per second). but the work has been on and off as i was assigned with other tasks. by the second half of 2020, i finally found a feasible way after many failures. after discussing the idea with industry leaders, we decided to deliver my research results by launching smartbch.
the main reason for choosing the bitcoin cash network is that it features big blocks. based on my professional background and work experience, i think optimization measures should be taken to give full play to the ability of the computing system itself. you can call it ‘brute force.’ however, ethereum prefers ‘subtle’ ways like sharding and layer2. the reason i choose to leverage the bitcoin cash protocol is because i’m a big supporter of bitcoin cash, and i think it is the most in line with the original vision of satoshi, which is to “serve as many people as possible.
bcn: can you explain to our readers how smartbch aims to enhance evm throughput and web3 apps?
wk: first we abandoned the single-thread semantics defined in ethereum’s yellow paper. single-thread semantics is not a must to support evm and web3 and it blocks many optimizations. second, we developed a lot of low-level libraries which support parallel execution of evm transactions to exploit the potential of modern cpu and ssd. last but not least, we optimized the evm execution engine and storage engine, which makes each evm instruction run faster.
bcn: have third-party bch developers been looking into the smartbch protocol?
wk: yes, we will have several companies confirmed and will join our testnet and participate to be the validator. and we have several new applications developed and dedicated for smartbch and several existing applications being ported to smartbch.
bcn: the throughput is quoted as being “one billion gas every 15 seconds.” can you explain how that will work?
wk: ethereum’s consensus engine and execution engine must be run in serial and in the block interval the new block must be executed several times on different peer-to-peer nodes, because it uses the proof-of-work (pow) consensus algorithm. by optimizing the consensus algorithm and allowing the consensus engine and execution engine to run concurrently, we must speed it by about five times.
by executing the evm transactions in parallel, we can speed up the execution by about ten times. and by reducing each evm instruction’s time consumption, we can further speed it up by about two to three times. so overall we are confident to speed up ethereum by 100 times.
bcn: how will bitcoin cash miners be affected by smartbch?
wk: bitcoin cash miners can vote for their validators on smartbch and get gas fee rewards, such that they can benefit from decentralized finance (defi) applications on smartbch.
bcn: would you say that smartbch will be able to produce the same results as a myriad of the defi apps built on ethereum? like stablecoins, amms, liquidity pools, decentralized exchanges (dexs), and tools of that nature.
wk: all the ethereum defi apps can be ported to smartbch with negligible efforts. also, we are expecting new applications which require high-throughput and low-gas-price to run will emerge on smartbch.
bcn: when you say “smart bitcoin cash’s innovation lies in libraries” what does that mean?
wk: instead of inventing fancy consensus and cryptographic algorithms, we decided to adopt another methodology: to develop low-level libraries with an aim to fully uncover the hardware’s potential, especially its inherent parallelism. ordinary users and developers are provided with a compatibility layer supporting evm and web3, so the optimized low-level ‘close to the metal’ libraries themselves remain concealed by this layer of abstraction. during the implementation, we used the codename ‘moeing,’ which is added to the libraries’ names as prefix.
these libraries follow the unix philosophy: simple, short, clear, modular, and extensible. other projects can reuse them and benefit from them.
bcn: as far as cryptocurrency in general, do you envision the industry seeing exponential growth going forward as we have seen during the end of 2020 and into 2021?
wk: i am not sure about what will happen in the near future. but in the long run, the population of the cryptocurrency community will surely grow exponentially. and smartbch is getting ready for the next 100x growth of onchain users.
what do you think about smartbch launching its testnet this week and the interview with the project’s tech lead wang kui? let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

$atom such a fascinating divergence. why is the sp down? did scott or any insider sell shares? are the company&#39;s prospects worse off? have the tutes bailed?  none of those. it is short term thinkers, meme chasers, and narrative spinners who want the sp down. to all of you, thanks for the cheap shares. i hope to see some of you in 2 years in the french riviera. until then, good night and god luck.

do immigrants harm native students academically?. by david figlio, paola giuliano, riccardo marchingiglio, umut özek, paola sapienza over the past 50 years, the united states has experienced the second-largest wave of immigration in its history. as a result, the share of recent immigrants (either foreign-born or children of foreign-born) in public schools reached 23% in 2015, with concentrations over 70% in several school districts in high-immigration states. these trends have generated a policy debate about the effects of immigration on public education and the perceived costs that immigrants may impose on public schools, local governments, and educational outcomes of the -born student population. better understanding the causal effects of immigrants on native students is therefore critical to inform these policy debates, yet there are two factors that complicate any effort to reveal this link. first, immigrant students are not randomly assigned to schools, and are more likely to enroll in schools educating students from disadvantaged backgrounds. second, -born students, especially those from comparatively affluent families, may decide to leave when a large share of immigrant students move into their school district—a phenomenon commonly referred to as “ native flight .” both factors imply that simple correlations between immigrant exposure and native student outcomes will likely yield a more negative relationship than the true causal effect of immigrant exposure. in a recent paper , we show how immigrant exposure affects the academic achievement of -born students. we do this with an analytical strategy that addresses both concerns above. we make use of rich, longitudinal education and health microdata from florida. these data are exceptionally detailed. for example, they identify students’ siblings in school records, which enables us to use the within-family, across-sibling variation in immigrant exposure to study the effects of immigrants. in other words, we can compare the learning of -born siblings when one of those siblings happened to have more immigrants in their school cohort than the other sibling(s). figure 1, illustrating our main result, shows the relationship between immigrant exposure and native student math scores, and how this relationship changes when one accounts for native flight. we present the results for all -born students (black bars), along with the results for white (green bars) and black students (blue bars) to demonstrate the effects for different student groups. the results on the left of the figure are from a common model that accounts for the non-random sorting of immigrants (by comparing -born students with their peers in the same school), yet does not address native flight. (that is, we compare the academic performance of native students with their peers in the same school who have different levels of exposure to immigrants because they are enrolled in different grades.) on the right of the figure, we present the results from our preferred model where we rely on sibling comparisons. several findings are worth highlighting. first, when we move from our baseline model to sibling comparisons that account for native flight, we see that the relationship between immigrant exposure and -born student test scores changes from negative to positive. second, we find that this trend is entirely driven by students from more advantaged backgrounds. for example, for white students, we find a negative relationship between immigrant exposure and math achievement in models that fail to account for native flight compared to a sizable positive relationship in our preferred model. in contrast, for black students, the positive effect of immigrant exposure remains virtually unchanged between the two models. this is consistent with the expectation that native flight is a bigger issue when examining the effects of immigrants on students from more advantaged backgrounds who can afford alternative schooling options in the wake of an immigrant influx. in summary, we find no adverse effects of immigrant students on the academic achievement of -born students. this is true even when the immigrants’ academic achievement is lower than the -born students. in fact, we find significant benefits of having immigrant peers on the test scores of native students, especially among students from disadvantaged backgrounds. this does not necessarily mean that immigrant students do not require public resources initially as they acquire english proficiency and get accustomed to the school system and life in a new country, which could have adverse effects on native students in the short-term—especially in the aftermath of large migrant inflows. that said, our findings suggest that, in the long run, the benefits of exposure to recent-immigrant peers, who are typically higher performing academically and have higher educational aspirations compared to more established immigrant generations , likely outweigh these potential short-term adverse effects.

nigerian petroleum corporation is broke, states won't pay workers salaries for may, june, july —dino melaye raises alarm. a former senator representing kogi west, senator dino melaye has alerted nigerians that the failure of the management of the nigerian national petroleum corporation to remit to the federation account for some months this year will make it difficult for states to pay salaries for the affected months. melaye spoke about a recent letter written by the nnpc to the accountant general of federation, informing him about the economic challenges facing the petroleum corporation. saharareporters had reported how the nnpc on wednesday raised the alarm that it recorded a value shortfall of n111,966,456, in february 2021 which will affect its contributions to the federal allocations to states for april and may. the nnpc in its correspondence dated april 26 explained that its shortfall is as a result of the landing cost of fuel which went up to “n184 per litre as against the subsisting ex-coastal price of n128 per litre” as the nigerian government and labour unions were still negotiating how on not to hike fuel prices. the nnpc chief financial officer, umar ajlya isa, wrote the letter, which was copied to the minister of finance, budget, and national planning, the director general, nigeria governors forum, the director home finance and the chairman, commissioners of finance forum. he stated that the nnpc would therefore not be contributing to the faac for april and may which will in turn affect the revenue to be shared among states of the federation the former senator, in a video posted on social media, said the nnpc cited the landing cost of pms in the month of march which was n184 as against n124. he said, "i am terribly worried as we faced insecurity challenges in this country. the more alarming danger of economy crisis that is looming is ahead of us. i want to announce to nigeria because i know we have a government that is not sincere, not honest and would not tell nigerians the truth.  "i owe it as an obligation to tell nigerians the bitter truth. i stumbled on a letter written by the nnpc and specifically signed by the chief financial officer of the nnpc, umaru ajia issa to the accountant general of federation intimating him that there would be zero contribution from nnpc to the national purse in the months of may, june and july. meaning that we should expect zero allocation from nnpc for those months.  "the implementation is that the revenue in these three months will only come from nigeria customs and firs (federal inland revenue service). we all know that the bulk of the revenue comes from nnpc. but now, the nnpc had written the accountant general of federation to announce to him officially that nnpc will not be able to contribute to faac in the said months because the landing cost of pms (premium motor spirit otherwise known as petrol) in the month of march was n184 as against n124. so because if this, nnpc is not in position to contribute to the revenue that will be share among the three tiers of government.  "the implication is that state will not be able to survive. states won't be able to pay salaries. this is a major catastrophy. this is happening because of the ineptitude of the leadership.  "it is happening because we have no leadership at the moment. the president is absent and it is the time for nigerians to know so that we can act. we are in a precarious situation and a very perilous time. the leadership is absent. we can only run to god. in unjust society, silence is a crime."

hc directs authorities to take steps to release oxygen concentrators seized from black market. the delhi high court on friday directed authorities to take immediate steps for release of 170 oxygen concentrators , which were seized by the delhi police from the black market , as they are required for the treatment of covid-19 patients. a bench of justices vipin sanghi and rekha palli asked the authorities to place compliance of its order by 1 pm. senior advocate sacchin puri informed the bench about news reports that 170 oxygen concentrators have been seized by the delhi police from the black market and urged the court to pass direction for their release so that they could be used by patients. the court said while legal proceedings may continue, it is the need of the hour that these equipment are released by authorities without any delay. the bench said, "we direct the state to immediately take steps and release these equipment." the bench said it had passed a similar order on thursday in which it had directed the deputy commissioner (dc) of the aap government's revenue department to issue orders for the release of remdesivir , used in the treatment of covid-19, as soon as the medicine is seized by the police from hoarders and black-marketeers.

bulgaria declares another russian diplomat persona non grata. minister of foreign affairs of bulgaria ekaterina zakharieva open source the ministry of foreign affairs of the republic of bulgaria declared another russian diplomat a persona non grata. the press service of the bulgarian foreign ministry reported this.  related: czech senate calls for the severance of treaty of friendship with russia  besides, the ministry of foreign affairs of bulgaria requested the law enforcement agencies of the russian federation to provide full assistance to the bulgarian authorities in investigating the explosions in bulgarian arms depots, destroying material evidence in a fire and poisoning of three bulgarian citizens so that the perpetrators can be identified and brought to justice.  related: ukraine’s foreign minister offered czech deportees job in kyiv  the deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs ekaterina zakharieva held an in-depth and serious conversation with the ambassador of the russian federation in sofia. “bulgaria wishes to maintain equal and mutually beneficial relations with russia and in this regard insists on active and effective assistance from the russian side to clarify the circumstances surrounding the incidents on our territory,” zakharieva said.  related: hungary not to expel russian diplomats over czech spy scandal  bulgaria's top diplomat said the foreign ministry reserved the right to retaliate and urged the ambassador to suspend actions incompatible with the vienna convention on diplomatic relations. as it was reported earlier, bulgaria's foreign ministry called out russia's ambassador to bulgaria for a "serious conversation." on april 28, it became clear that a russian trace is being investigated in the explosions in ammunition factories in our country. the prosecution compared four such cases in which similarities were observed. they have happened in the last 10 years. in march, bulgarian security officials exposed a spy network that had been working for russia. in response to the expulsion of russian diplomats from bulgaria, russia declared two employees of the embassy of this country in moscow persona non grata .  previously, the minister of foreign affairs jan hamacek decided to expel from the czech republic 18 russian diplomats who are suspected of work for special services of the russian federation.  later, the bulgarian trader and arms manufacturer emilian gebrev admitted that he kept ammunition in a czech weapons depot, as well as the sending of military equipment to ukraine after 2014. in 2015, gebrev was poisoned. eventually, the bulgarian prosecutor's office accused three gru officers in early 2020.

sprint to finish. as india inc's january-march quarter results for fy21 trickle in, early birds bring good tidings of robust earnings momentum. companies look set for a strong show in q4 on a low base in the previous fiscal. however, the recent surge in infections and sporadic curbs by states could prove to be a dampener for the earnings story in fy22. it bellwether tata consultancy services (tcs) kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season on april 12 with a 14.9 per cent year-on-year growth in consolidated net profit and a 9.4 per cent increase in topline. infosys and wipro followed with double-digit growths in consolidated profits at 17.5 per cent and 27.7 per cent, respectively, and 13.1 per cent and 3.4 per cent increase in revenues. these numbers could be the harbinger of a healthy earnings season in a year ravaged by the pandemic. earnings estimates analysts believe the base effect due to a sudden lockdown in march '20 and cyclical sectors such as metals, banks and cements would lead the earnings acceleration. "q4fy21 is expected to be a stellar quarter representing the continuation of a sequential recovery, driven by a gradual economic re-opening and robust demand reflecting a strong pick-up in cyclical sectors. the positive earnings momentum of the last two quarters is likely to sustain in q4, led by a sharp demand revival across segments. this is further supported by the lower base of last year," says neeraj chadawar, head, quantitative equity research, axis securities. sanjeev prasad, co-head, institutional equities, kotak institutional equities expects net profits of bse-30 companies to increase 55 per cent y-o-y and 6 per cent quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) and for the nifty 50 ones to increase 125 per cent y-o-y and 8 per cent q-o-q. "bpcl, ioc and tata motors - which had reported huge losses in q4fy20 - are not a part of the 30-scrip sensex, while they are very much part of the nifty 50, accounting for the large divergence in performance of the sensex and the nifty," he adds. past performances with the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions coupled with diminishing supply side constraints, net sales of nifty 50 companies and nifty 500 recorded the first y-o-y expansion in the post-pandemic period, registering a 0.9 per cent and 3 per cent growth each in the december quarter. improved consumption during the festival season and aggressive cost-cutting measures undertaken by companies also boosted profits at the operating level - it grew by 17.1 per cent and 19.2 per cent y-o-y, respectively, for nifty 50 and nifty 500 companies (excluding financing costs). full-year assessment fy21 is likely to end with a bang, aided by an uptick in global and domestic macroeconomic activity. "fiscal year 2020/21 is expected to end with a healthy 13 per cent earnings per share (eps) growth for the nifty, the highest in last six years," says gautam duggad, head of research, motilal oswal institutional equities. the recent surge in covid cases is unlikely to impact q4fy21 estimates, even as it poses risks for fy22 earnings delivery. likewise, an edelweiss research report pegs a 21 per cent earnings growth in fy21 for nifty companies, the highest in a decade. this is owing to global reflation (expansion in the level of output of an economy by government stimulus, using either fiscal or monetary policy), cost rationalisation measures by corporates, and market share gains from the unorganised sector. going ahead, the resurgence in covid cases (in india and globally) and potentially higher interest rates pose a risk to fy22 earnings outlook, it added. sectoral outlook metals: according to axis securities' chadawar, "profits of the metals sector are expected to more than double in q4fy21 due to demand surge. furthermore, operating performance is likely to be strong, driven by demand and higher metal prices." the metals and mining space is expected to register a 26 per cent growth in revenues, while ebitda is pegged to increase by 109 per cent, on a yearly basis. specialty chemical & auto: specialty chemical companies are expected to report a 40 per cent growth in bottomline numbers on the back of a strong outlook for the industry at large. however, margins are likely to be hit by higher input costs and supply-side issues led by a shortage of shipping containers, adds chadawar. in the automobile space, demand will remain strong during the quarter led by sequential economic recovery, continued preference for personal mobility, and rural push. "ebitda margins are likely to be lower sequentially due to raw material cost headwinds. commodity cost pressure is likely to be higher, leading to pressure on margins in q4," he adds. it: strong deal wins, continued traction in digital and cloud augurs well for indian it companies. "we expect companies in our coverage universe to further accelerate y-o-y revenue growth momentum on broad-based demand, strong deal wins, ramp-up of large deals and demand recovery in highly impacted verticals. revenues of tier-i it companies are likely to grow by 2.2-3.9 per cent q-o-q in constant currency (cc) terms. cross-currency movement is likely to aid us dollar revenue by 80-110 basis points in q4 for tier-ii companies. these companies are likely to report slightly better sequential growth numbers of 2.5-4.5 per cent q-o-q in cc terms on the back of healthy deal wins and a strong pipeline, client mining, and consistent execution," says dipesh mehta, analyst, emkay global financial services. margins, however, may take a hit sequentially due to salary hikes, bonuses and a strong rupee. fmcg: consumption shift in key categories from the unorganised to the organised sector led to encouraging outcomes in the past two quarters. "we believe the growth momentum has continued in q4fy21 as well. low base due to lockdown in march 2020 has further aided growth. our coverage universe is expected to witness a 20.2 per cent revenue growth on account of sales decline of 7-15 per cent in the base quarter," says an icici direct research report. packaged foods, edible oil, immunity boosting product are likely to continue the growth momentum in q4. discretionary categories like cosmetics and juices will also witness strong growth due to pent-up demand. banks: banks' net profits are likely to double in q4, led by lesser provisioning due to the pandemic. "q4fy21 will be the first quarter of actual reporting of npas after the supreme court standstill ended. this will provide better clarity on the asset quality front," says axis securities' chadawar. slippages are expected to be higher during q4fy21, with an improved asset quality outlook in fy22 and fy23. margins, however, may take a hit sequentially due to salary hikes, bonuses and a strong rupee. as of now, management commentaries will set the tone for the current fiscal. going ahead, duggad believes the interplay of resurgence in covid cases and the pace of vaccination would decide the trajectory of recovery.

morphological comparison of blocks in chaos terrains on pluto, europa, and mars. helle l. skjetne, kelsi n. singer, brian m. hynek, katie i. knight, paul m. schenk, cathy b. olkin, oliver l. white, tanguy bertrand, kirby d. runyon, william b. mckinnon, jeffrey m. moore, s. alan stern, harold a. weaver, leslie a. young, kim ennicochaos terrains are characterized by disruption of preexisting surfaces into irregularly arranged mountain blocks with a chaotic appearance. several models for chaos formation have been proposed, but the formation and evolution of this enigmatic terrain type has not yet been fully constrained. we provide extensive mapping of the individual blocks that make up different chaos landscapes, and present a morphological comparison of chaotic terrains found on pluto, jupiter's moon europa, and mars, using measurements of diameter, height, and axial ratio of chaotic mountain blocks. additionally, we compare mountain blocks in chaotic terrain and fretted terrain on mars. we find a positive linear relationship between the size and height of chaos blocks on pluto and mars, whereas blocks on europa exhibit a flat trend as block height does not generally increase with increasing block size. block heights on pluto are used to estimate the block root depths if they were floating icebergs. block heights on europa are used to infer the total thickness of the icy layer from which the blocks formed. finally, block heights on mars are compared to potential layer thicknesses of near-surface material. we propose that the heights of chaotic mountain blocks on pluto, europa, and mars can be used to infer information about crustal lithology and surface layer thickness.

2021 indian challenger limited review: a super-bagger for the rest of us. with 122 horsepower, sportbike brakes and a modern suspension, the challenger looks to leave other american baggers in the stone age. indian's challenger limited feels like a bagger for people who hate baggers, or maybe for people who've had to give up other, sportier kinds of motorcycles due to age or injury. it's got all the bagger bonafides -- hard bags, big fairing, feet-forward controls -- but it also has a modern suspension, high-performance brakes and a seriously nasty (in a good way) liquid-cooled engine. it's different, but i love it. that big, 108-cubic-inch, liquid-cooled engine goes a long way towards endearing this bike to me. unlike most air-cooled baggers or tourers, which focus on torque at the expense of horsepower, this engine offers both: 122 horsepower and 128 pound-feet of torque. that horsepower number is impressive, too, because the bike only revs to 6,500 rpm and, of course, revs equal power. that big beast of an engine -- which, i should add, indian offers performance parts for, like cams and intakes to make it even more powerful -- is mated to a very nice-to-use six-speed transmission. the gearbox isn't subtle or slick, but it shifts positively between gears with a very satisfying thunk and i never have issues with finding neutral or getting false neutrals. the clutch is a wet, multi-plate unit and while the lever is rightfully heavy given what it has to control, the engagement is smooth. the challenger's suspension is arguably the most sophisticated setup available for an american-style cruiser. it features a 43-millimeter inverted cartridge-style fork and a hydraulically adjustable fox rear monoshock. these work together to help control the challenger's bulk -- all 831 pounds of it when fully fueled. the challenger handles well enough that people road race them in the increasingly popular king of the baggers series . the braking system is almost as impressive as the suspension. the bike gets dual 320-millimeter floating rotors and four-piston brembo monoblock calipers up front, with a 298-millimeter rotor and single dual-piston caliper out back. there is a lean-sensitive anti-lock braking system fitted to dark horse and limited models powered by a six-axis bosch inertial measurement unit. the challenger features a pretty robust suite of electronic rider aids. there are multiple ride modes -- standard, rain and sport -- and they are adjustable on the fly through the bike's glove-friendly touchscreen. there is also a lean-sensitive traction control system that works well, even when the rider decides to get a bit ham-fisted with the throttle -- something that's easy to do, given the dinosaur-roar of that big engine in its upper rev range. riding the challenger is an interesting exercise in duality, depending on where you're trying to ride. i live in downtown los angeles and riding the challenger here is miserable. it's huge, which can make filtering between cars at a stop difficult. it's also super heavy, so there's always the fear that it'll tip over during a low-speed maneuver. if that happens on a regular bike, it's embarrassing, but you can pick it up and keep going. with the challenger, i doubt i'd be able to sling its 800-pound bulk up by myself. when you get out of town, the challenger completely transforms. what was huge and heavy now feels comfortable and stable at speed. the big fairing provides excellent wind protection and the massive engine smoothes out and purrs along with a sense of near-limitless power. the huge 6-gallon gas tank means that you don't have to worry about timing your fuel stops. the challenger is a bike meant to crush a continent, with plenty of twisty roads along the way. in this setting, it's brilliant. indian calls the challenger a "sports bagger," so i feel obligated to test the bike's handling chops on the same canyon roads i use to test  and lamborghinis. in this case, the experience is both rewarding and a little terrifying. the challenger does a great job of controlling its weight through the fast curves. its sportbike-spec brakes also do an admirable job of hauling the leviathan down from speed, but i can't get used to having my feet out in front of me and trying to force so much weight around. will the bike do it? absolutely. is it something i'd like to do again? hell no. a highlight of the challenger experience for me is its standard electronically adjustable windscreen. it makes a massive difference in how much air hits the rider. in town, i want the screen low so i don't overheat behind the enormous front fairing. on the freeway, i want it high so that the worst of the windblast goes over me. there are a pair of ducts on the fairing and an opening in the windscreen that is exposed in the high setting to provide some airflow. on the long rides to which the challenger is so well suited, having tunes on hand is key. to that end, indian's standard ridecommand infotainment system offers quite a bit of functionality, including apple carplay integration. music can be played through your helmet's bluetooth integration and or through the standard 100-watt stereo system, which features a pair of 6.5-inch speakers built into the fairing. there are also a number of trip-tracking features built-in and even a tire pressure monitoring system. above the ridecommand screen is a pair of analog gauges -- speedometer and tachometer -- with trip computer leds. one weird omission on the challenger is the lack of standard heated grips. heated grips are available as a dealer-installed accessory, and they do have 10 settings, but they're an extra $309 plus labor. that's stupid on a luxury touring bike that retails for nearly $28,000. i'd also like to see a heated seat, but it appears that the only bike in the class that offers that as standard is the bmw  k1600gt , so i'll give the big indian a pass. after several months of living with the 2021 indian challenger, i grew to love it for what it is: a big, fast and very comfortable long-distance motorcycle. it's a bike that does an admirable job of justifying its price tag -- as high as it is -- and which offers surprising levels of performance.  at the end of the day, though, with the challenger's weight and ergonomics, i'd rather buy a honda with its mid-mounted controls and smoother flat-six engine. still, the fact that an american v-twin cruiser is even in the running with the 'wing represents a huge leap forward for indian. climb in the driver's seat for the latest car news and reviews, delivered to your inbox twice weekly.

$+ billion data governance market – global growth, trends, and forecasts 2021-2026 –  the “data governance market – growth, trends, covid-19 impact, and forecasts (2021 – 2026)” report has been added to ’s  offering . the data governance market is expected to register a cagr of over %, during the forecast period, 2021 – 2026, and it is expected to reach a value of usd  billion by 2026. the amount of data created by devices is nearly 100 times greater than the amount of data stored, according to the cisco global cloud index. according to forbes, there are 2.5 quintillion bytes of data created each day at the current pace, but that pace is only accelerating the growth of the internet of things (iot). according to the aureus analytics report, the world’s data volume is expected to grow by 40% per year and 50 times by 2020. human and machine-generated data are experiencing an overall growth of data, 10 times larger than traditional business data. with the growing new technologies, such as iot and the artificial intelligence companies, such as walmart , are adopting data governance solutions to ensure enterprise data is authorized and organized in a database, with as few errors as possible while maintaining, both privacy and security. growing regulatory and compliance mandates are also expected to boost the demand for the data governance market. one such example is gdpr (general data protection regulation), which was passed into uk law through the data protection act 2018, that strengthens data protection provisions for all european union data subjects. the regulation was enforced in may 2018. according to eol it services, the biggest challenges in data governance for 2018 is employee compliance, ie, ensuring that employees comply with overall data strategy, something often borne out by a lack of understanding rather than a lack of desire.  key market trends   healthcare sector leads the market in europe and north america region      iot has a lot of applications in healthcare, from remote monitoring to medical device integration. it also has the potential to not only keep patients healthy and safe but also to improve how physicians deliver care, as well.  but, iot also brings along with it the need for data governance for the healthcare sector, as the industry struggle with the massive amount of data produced by sensors, wearables, remote monitors , and other medical devices.  according to european telecommunications network operators’ association (etno), the number of iot units in healthcare in the european union (eu) is expected to increase year-on-year.  the us healthcare regulation, hipaa, provides protection over patients’ data. securing patients’ private medical history and health records are of the utmost importance within the healthcare market.    asia-pacific to be the fastest growing market    the region of asia-pacific is projected to be the fastest-growing region for the data governance market, owing to the growing technology expenditures in economies, such as china, india, singapore, and australia. the demand for cost-effective data management and governance solutions and services among small- and medium-sized enterprises (smes) are further driving the demand for the data governance market in the region.  solidatus, a provider of a data lineage and business relationship mapping solution, opened an office in singapore to address the demand in the asia-pacific region markets.  with vast amounts of data being created every day, japanese prime minister, shinzo abe, declared, in february 2019, that the next g-20 summit should wrestle with how to manage that digital information.  the general data protection regulation (gdpr) is causing asia-pacific to reassess their data strategy and ensure they can earn the trust of consumers who are increasingly wary of how their data is being used.    competitive landscape  as data governance is the key to delivering trust and compliance, every organization needs to derive real value from its data. the market is fragmented with the companies entering into strategic mergers and acquisitions, to leverage the growing demand

wfs secures brussels airport handling contract from singapore airlines. france-based worldwide flight services (wfs) has secured a contract from singapore airlines (sq sia) for providing airport handling services at brussels airport (bru) in belgium.          the terminal has a devoted pharma area and a kiosk-based, self-service reception spots for truck drivers. credit: ionutscripcaru / pixabay.   france-based worldwide flight services (wfs) has secured a contract from singapore airlines (sq sia) for providing airport handling services at brussels airport (bru) in belgium. in addition to this three-year contract, the entities have renewed their current agreements in paris, london and manchester. according to the contract, worldwide flight services will support five boeing 747 cargo flights of the airlines which will operate on a weekly basis from brussels. this supports the company’s new 250,000t capacity freight centre at brussels airport. this investment came less than two years after worldwide flight services launched an additional 9,000m² terminal in the brucargo west development. the new terminal has been built by the company to support the premium goods of its clients. for enhancing efficiency and customer experience, the terminal features new technologies. the terminal also has a devoted pharma area and kiosk-based, self-service reception spots for truck drivers. these points allow the drivers to stay in their trucks while finishing cargo deliveries and collections, advancing their assignment to one of the terminal’s 40 cargo gates. furthermore, the new building has been installed with security access controls and cargo screening technologies for addressing security concerns. worldwide flight services group chief commercial officer barry nassberg said: “this is a significant strengthening of our relationship with singapore airlines and represents big gains for our operations in belgium, france and the uk because of the airline’s size and importance in the market. we understand this responsibility and greatly value singapore airlines’ confidence in worldwide flight services.”
ark also predicted almost 100% cagr in deliveries for 5 years. they are getting ahead of themselves.

baidu to roll out driverless robotaxis in beijing in may. baidu will launch a paid robotaxi service in beijing on saturday, allowing users to book rides in vehicles without a driver behind the wheel, as the tech giant seeks to become one of china’s first companies to make money from self-driving technology. the service will initially only be available in shougang industrial park, one of the venues for the 2022 beijing winter olympics, where users will be limited to rides between sports halls, work areas, coffee shops and hotels in a geofenced area, baidu said in a statement thursday. because they won’t have backup drivers, the robotaxis will be connected to a 5g-based remote control system designed to ensure the rides are safe, according to the statement. a company spokesperson told caixin that the taxis will come with a baidu employee in the front passenger’s seat tasked with putting nervous passengers at ease, especially in the early phase of the rollout. passengers can order up a ride through baidu’s apollo go app for a flat fee of 30 yuan ($), the spokesperson said. “in the future, baidu apollo will launch driverless robotaxis in more cities, allowing the public to access greener, low-carbon and convenient transportation,” said wang yunpeng, general manager of autonomous driving technology at baidu. baidu, which aims to have its apollo autonomous driving system installed in 1 million vehicles over the next three to five years, has also received two government permits allowing it to test out charging passengers in its robobus and robotaxi pilot programs, which are running respectively in the cities of chongqing and cangzhou. in january, alibaba-backed chinese autonomous vehicle startup autox launched a driverless robotaxi pilot program in shenzhen in a major step toward commercializing completely driverless vehicle services. contact reporter ding yi () related: baidu and geely plan $7.7 billion smart car push

eu should impose anti-corruption sanctions on russians, meps say. the european union should follow britain’s example and impose new anti-corruption sanctions on russians suspected of fraud and graft, the european parliament said on thursday (29 april) in a resolution that reflected hardening attitudes to moscow. non-eu member britain imposed sanctions on monday on 14 russians under a new law giving the british government the power to penalise those it says are credibly involved in the most serious corruption abroad. if eu governments follow up on the resolution, such measures would freeze the european union assets of russians and other non-eu nationals and bar them from visiting the 27-nation bloc, as britain has done for its banks and territory. the resolution, which is not binding but carries political weight, was adopted by 569 votes in favour, 67 against and with 46 abstentions. accusing the kremlin of “posing an external threat to european security” and “waging an internal war on its own people,” eu lawmakers also said russian funds “of unclear origin” should be banned from the bloc. “european union countries should no longer be welcoming places for russian wealth and investments of unclear origin,” the resolution said. it called on the european commission and eu governments to do more to stop any russian state investment “used for subversion, undermining democratic processes and institutions, and spreading corruption”. russia’s mission to the eu was not immediately available for comment, but moscow has repeatedly warned the eu not to meddle in its internal affairs. the parliament’s common position underscores a change in tone on russia, a major energy supplier to the eu which many long considered a partner nation. now lawmakers are increasingly unified in their rejection of authoritarianism under president vladimir putin. andrzej halicki, a polish centre-right lawmaker, said: “we need to impose sanctions on the russian oligarchs,” referring to members of the country’s business elite. the forthright language follows an eu report on wednesday accusing russian state media of sowing disinformation in the bloc to undermine confidence in western covid-19 vaccines. russia denies any such tactics. condemning the russian military build-up on ukraine’s borders earlier this month, the parliament’s resolution said the eu should exclude russia from the international payments network swift if the kremlin launches any incursions into ukraine. russia says it has no such intentions and said the troops near ukraine and in crimea, the ukrainian peninsula that moscow annexed in 2014, were part of defensive military drills. the resolution was welcomed by ukraine’s foreign minister dmytro kuleba, who called it robust. “these are signals ukraine has asked for, clearly showing russia possible costs of extending its aggression,” he said on twitter.

magistrate raps police ‘inefficiency’ in zurrieq double-decker tragedy case. a magistrate has rapped the prosecution in the compilation of evidence against the driver of a double decker bus that was involved in a fatal accident in 2018. charles d’amato stands accused of involuntary homicide. two people had died when the open top bus hit a tree branch in zurrieq on 9 april of three years ago. in march, the court had cleared the direcetors of the sighteesing company of criminal liability but had placed d’amato under indictment. during friday morning’s sitting, magistrate joseph mifsud pointed out that the prosecution was summoning a number of witnesses who had already testified in the magisterial inquiry. this, he said, was causing unnecessary duplication of testimony. defence lawyer franco debono also objected to this, saying that the criminal code exempts the compilation of evidence from having to hear all the witnesses heard in the inquiry. magistrate mifsud also pointed out that some of the charges may be time-barred since they were filed more than two years after the incident took place. one particular charge, that of causing slight bodily harm, requires a complaint from the injured party, bit this was not presented in the acts of the case. the court also chastised the prosecution for summoning every single police officer who was at the scene. “you’re coming here to confirm the inefficiency of the police because they all went to the scene yet they didn’t take care to file the charges in time,” the magistrate said. the case continues in june. inspector giannetta grixti and superintendent josric mifsud are prosecuting. lawyers franco debono, francois dalli, francesca zarb and celine marie dalli appeared for charles d’amato. lawyer mattia felice appeared parte civile for one of the victims.

the only thing the government and busy body fucktards such as yourself are doing is taking away opportunities for those who want to work part time for companies that will allow them to work when they want and for how long they want. while you and the rest of you holier-than-thou scum are patting yourselves on the back those who chose to work for these companies will be scrambing trying to figure out how to replace the income they've lost because you've determined they are too stupid to run their own lives and need to be saved."

kansas city golf course with lawn care goof will be closed for at least another month. jackson county’s golf course goof just got worse. the fred arbanas golf course at longview lake has extended its closure until mid-june due to a mistake that damaged the greens on 95 percent of the course. it had been scheduled to reopen next week after being shut down for a month while the greens were repaired. the county said the new reopening date is june 11. “i know this is not the news that any of us want to hear,” parks + rec director michele newman said in a news release late thursday afternoon. “it was not an easy decision for us to make, however, it is necessary as preparing the best putting surface possible takes time and patience. we are taking every measure possible to ensure our patrons have the golfing experience they expect at fred arbanas when we reopen.” the county closed the course after determining that chemicals applied to the greens last fall left brown spots on 95 percent of them. new sod was hauled in from colorado at a cost of $28,000, but it was dormant and some of it did not take root after it was laid, the county said. “the inclement weather and snow also hindered the growing process,” the county’s news release said. the dead sod is being replaced by a local supplier at a cost of an additional $3,000, newman said, but her fingers are crossed. “the weather will also have an impact on our efforts, so we are hopeful conditions are better than they have been the past few weeks to allow us to reopen by our tentatively scheduled date,” newman said. the star was the first to report the turf maintenance mishap. between the cost of buying and laying the colorado sod, along with a month’s worth of lost revenues from golfers, the county had estimated it would be out more than $120,000. of that total, $85,000 was in lost revenue for april. closing the course for another month or more would seem to push the overall financial hit past $200,000. but officials did not make themselves available for comment thursday evening. the county has not disclosed who made the mistakes that damaged the course. in april, workers began replacing damaged sod on the course’s greens with sod hauled in from a colorado supplier who grew the same variety as the damaged turf. the county’s own sod farm was depleted from last year’s renovation of the county’s par 3 course, according to a memo from newman to county executive frank white obtained by the star. newman requested the emergency purchase in march, after discovering that the excessive application of pre-emergent herbicide last fall had killed the grass. when the county announced on its website in early april that the course was being closed for greens restoration, it did not volunteer why the work was needed at the start of the golf season when tee times were in great demand. of bigger financial concern was the hit to county revenues, as green fees and other purchases at the course help support other parks + rec activities. “it is our parks department’s largest generator of revenue,” dan tarwater, chairman of the county legislature, explained at a public meeting on april 12 without letting on why the renovation was needed at that time with an emergency purchase order. from colorado arrived in two shipments in refrigerated trucks, newman said in her memo to white. the colorado supplier was chosen because no local sod farms grow that variety, according to an april 5 finance department memo sent to the nine county legislators. thursday’s news release did not say whether that same variety is now being used to replace the dead sod, and if so who is supplying it. at the april 12 meeting, tarwater asked that golfers withhold judgment on the appearance of the new greens until the sod had a chance to get established. he said the new turf was dormant when it was cut and delivered to the course, which in 1999 was named in honor of the former county legislator and kansas city chiefs player fred arbanas, who died this month. “it’s going to be better and stronger” than the decade-old turf it replaced, he said then.

excess deaths in 2020. in my country medical help got way more difficult to get in early 2020 despite having comparatively few cases. hospitals were not overrun. it was purely because of lockdowns and constant scaremongering.

iran again boosts opec oil output in april - reuters survey. london (reuters) -opec oil output has risen in april as higher supply from iran countered involuntary cuts and agreed reductions by other members under a pact with allies, a reuters survey found, adding to signs of a 2021 recovery in tehran's exports. the 13-member organization of the petroleum exporting countries pumped  million barrels per day (bpd) in april, the survey found, up 100,000 bpd from march. output has risen every month since june 2020 with the exception of february. iran's exports are rising as talks take place to revive a 2015 nuclear deal which could eventually allow more oil to the market.  president joe biden's administration took office in january pledging to rejoin the accord. so far, opec and its allies, known as opec+, are not concerned by iran and plan their own output boost from may. "the elevated levels that we are seeing from iran are generally continuing," daniel gerber, chief executive of petro-logistics, a consultant that tracks oil shipments, told reuters this month. hoping for a demand recovery, opec+ this week confirmed a plan to ease from may more of the record cuts made in 2020. from may saudi arabia will also begin to unwind an extra voluntary cut it made in february, march and april. the extra saudi cut means opec still pumped much less than called for under the opec+ deal in april. compliance with pledged cuts was 123%, the survey found, versus 124% in march. iran, plus fellow opec members libya and venezuela, are exempt from making cuts, so changes in their output do not affect the compliance rate. more from iran iran has managed to raise exports since the fourth quarter despite  sanctions, according to various assessments of the shipments. the survey puts iranian supply in april at 2.5 million bpd, up 200,000 bpd from march and the biggest rise in opec. there were small increases in algeria, nigeria and angola. top exporter saudi arabia kept output steady, delivering on its additional cut pledge for a third month. output was also steady in the united arab emirates and kuwait, the survey found. libya and venezuela posted notable declines. libya on april 19 declared force majeure on exports from its hariga oil terminal due to a budget dispute with the central bank, and production dropped. the force majeure was lifted this week. venezuelan output, which has been edging up in recent months, fell back amid a shortage of medium and light crude for blending operations to produce exportable crude grades, the survey found. the reuters survey aims to track supply to the market and is based on shipping data provided by external sources, refinitiv eikon flows data, information from tanker trackers such as petro-logistics and kpler, and information provided by sources at oil companies, opec and consultants.
